After learning all the ways my mom has abused and took advantage of me, I think there should be more info on this. All I've heard, all my life, even from my doctors was, ""Oh it must be so hard for you, taking care of her."" And all this stuff about how tired she must be, etc...they never checked on me to see if this caregiver burnout turned into something else. 

So many things have happened to me that I didn't even know counted as severe abuse, it was so hard to reach out, I cannot even imagine how hard it is for autistic people who don't know any ways to reach out. I think there should be more resources on this, like a lot of resources. People should be more educated on things like this, considering how serious it is. It's easy to isolate autistic people who have other health conditions and higher support needs, which makes it far easier to abuse them.

Anyways, what do you think?","AutismInWomen",137,"https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismInWomen/comments/156s4cd/i_think_there_should_be_more_info_about_abuse_of/"

(By success here I mean a university degree and various other accolades)

I know I sound vindictive and mean but I finally realized why its so hard for me to fully empathize with successful people, even if theyre traumatized, even autistic. 

They overcame it all. They didnt let their trauma consume them. They have degrees and achievements to fall back on, merit and dignity amassed from their many successes despite the amount of trauma that befell them. Its different when youre a college dropout financially bound in a racist city. Im perpetually broke and burnt out and always focused on survival. 

A nasty mix of insecurities, intersectional identities, racism, undiagnosed autism and adhd actually *did* manage to consume me, it drowned me. I feel stunted. It resulted in my being 28 and still just as heedless as ever. Always so lost. I cant relate to autistic people who have graduate degrees and various other ventures. Its hard to relate to anyone and it really fucking hurts.

The thing is I know Im mentally capable of doing great things. I know some extremely bright and talented people, and am able to converse and engage with them intellectually, so I know Im capable.

The you act older just build high expectations for me, that everyone would be nerdy and interesting to be around when I get older.

I remember I was like really good at scratch when I was like 7 and people were like youre so good for your age, that just made me think that when i got older everyone would know scratch.

But then the second someone else enters the room, the conversation drops and theyll start talking to the other person like I wasnt in mid sentence.

The latest version of the DSM, **DSM-5-TR**, was published in March 2022. It is brand new, and has some language included that should make diagnosis easier for women. I'm posting this for anyone who might feel more prepared going to their provider with this information. The full pdf is [available for download at this site](https://b-ok.cc/book/21146209/dc7441/?wrongHash).

Here are some relevant excerpts for women seeking diagnosis as adults.

From the ""**Diagnostic Features**"" section:

&gt;Criterion A deficits in social communication will be more subtle if an individual has better overall communication skills (e.g., is verbally fluent, does not have intellectual impairments).

I included this entire section, and bolded a part I think is particularly relevant for many women seeking late diagnosis.

&gt;**Sex- and Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues**  
&gt;  
&gt;Autism spectrum disorder is diagnosed three to four times more often in males than in females, and on average, age at diagnosis is later in females. In clinic samples, females tend to be more likely to show accompanying intellectual developmental disorder as well as epilepsy, suggesting that girls without intellectual impairments or language delays may go unrecognized, perhaps because of subtler manifestation of social and communication difficulties. ***In comparison with males with autism spectrum disorder, females may have better reciprocal conversation, and be more likely to share interests, to integrate verbal and nonverbal behavior, and to modify their behavior by situation, despite having similar social understanding difficulties as males. Attempting to hide or mask autistic behavior (e.g., by copying the dress, voice, and manner of socially successful women) may also make diagnosis harder in some females.*** Repetitive behaviors may be somewhat less evident in females than in males, on average, and special interests may have a more social (e.g., a singer, an actor) or normative focus (e.g., horses), while remaining unusual in their intensity. Relative to the general population, rates of gender variance have been reported to be increased in autism spectrum disorder, with higher variance in females compared with males.","AutismInWomen",72,"https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismInWomen/comments/ug2v7y/gender_differences_as_addressed_in_the_dsm5tr/"

I'm shocked - when there is so much evidence that says it is traumatic and harmful.

That many things in our everyday life *are* ableist. 

For professional development, we had to have a discussion about how to have conversations with people. And so many of these points are ableist because they're built with neurotypical people in mind. For example, don't multitask when someone is talking to you or don't focus on making eye contact because that will come naturally. And I'm just here like, ummm no. Eye contact doesn't always come naturally, and I concentrate better on speech when I'm doing something else, at least physically. I get so frustrated when people tell me to stop doing something else and to just stare at them while they talk. 

Anyway, it's just really frustrating specifically because I work with Special Education. At any other workplace, I don't expect people to care, but their job here is about understanding and advocating for children with disabilities. How can they ever hope to do that when they never stop to seriously think about how ableist it is to expect everyone to navigate the world the same way? I find there is a lot of ableism in this field, ironically. And it's incredibly frustrating as a whole. It breaks my heart each time I get dismissed this way. But it's also why I want to stay in this field.

Like most people, I have to work to survive. There isn't any other option.

During the Pandemic I was happy for the first time in my 31 years of life and I really miss it. While I know for many people there was a lot of fear and uncertainty - and it was very difficult.

 I was fortunate enough to be able to collect PUA. Like most people on PUA, I was making way more money than I do normally. For the first time in my life I didn't have to stress about money, I was able to afford rent &amp; food no problem + splurge on some items I was really wanting  like a new comfortable mattress which really helps my bad back and a laptop my other one was 11 years old. I was able to afford seeing a therapist! I was able to afford to go to a chiropractor for my bad back!!! Without having to work I had soo much energy during the day to do things I enjoyed. I was happy, pain free, and actually enjoying my life for the first time ever. I was actually happy to wake up everyday in the morning and looked forward to my day. 

While I know some of this is controversial - it's pretty sad that a global pandemic was the best time of my life.

Now I'm back to working my ass off, barely scraping buy, in pain, depressed, burnt out, every morning I wake up I wish I didn't - and I push myself through the day just waiting for the moment I get to go back to sleep. Being asleep is the only time I am happy.

Many of us do not get the level of support for and space to figure out our career challenges that we really need.
* On average, women are not as interested in systems/objects-focused jobs such as engineering as men are, so that can eliminate a bunch of autism-friendly job options for some of us (my autism-spectrum dad was an engineer and didn't understand why I didn't just do the same thing, but it was not a fit for my interests and personality) 
* The social, behavioral, and appearance expectations for women in the workplace or in professional interactions are higher.

but getting work right really matters for autistic women, because 

* women are also very prone to burnout, autoimmune illnesses, etc. we have a hormonal situation that can make us more vulnerable to stress (we are not necessarily protected by high testosterone, as men are). 

luckily

* We often have high intelligence, drive, creativity, research ability. and if we just know that it's a problem if we hate work and feel like it's torture (it's not normal to feel that horrible about it), we can often figure it out (e.g. by [finding the rare work that is as comfortable for us as our favorite clothes](https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismInWomen/comments/194dely/we_need_special_work_just_like_we_need_special/)).

Some thoughts.","Idk how many of you follow the antiwork sub or general Reddit drama, so heres a little summary: a leftist antiwork sub got very popular and was starting to get some press. Fox News reached out for an interview, and after the entire sub voted against participating, the mod team decided one of them would do the interview anyway. This person was not prepared to handle any media, let alone opposition media, and the interview was very embarrassing to the cause and may have ended the influence of the sub. 

So why am I posting about this here? Because the mod has autism. Part of the problem a lot of people saw with the interview was that the mod works part time walking dogs and said laziness is a virtue. Which, of course, led to accusations of laziness and generalizations about other antiwork participants. 

But aside from all the valid criticism of the decision to do the interview and the way it was done, theres something that really struck me, as an autistic person who cant work full time AND maintain my mental health& 

There was no discussion about the fact that autistic children become autistic adults and that what little support we had ends. Working full time isnt any easier than attending school was, and most of us land out on our own to deal with executive dysfunction, overstimulation, and usually severe anxiety all on our own and then are called lazy when we cant hold a traditional job due to burnout. 

Disability financial support in the US is fucking garbage, but its difficult to impossible for autistic adults to even qualify.

BUT ALSO there's nothing wrong with people who like being alone. We exist!

I'm tired of people telling me ""you should hang out with people more"" ""you should put yourself out there"" ""you don't have to be a loner"" etc. but the thing is I WOULD RATHER BE ALONE! I would always rather be alone! And there's nothing wrong with that. It's more comfortable for me!

Sure, there are a rare few (1 or 2) people I actually enjoy being with, but in general when I'm hanging out with other folks I would always rather be elsewhere. It doesn't necessarily mean I hate them (in fact I adore some of my acquaintances!), and I *might* actually have fun being around them, but it just never beats being alone.

I can just never be myself around others. Having to mask is just exhausting, it feels physically and psychologically uncomfortable (and even painful), and I wish people understood that I just enjoy solitude and sometimes socializing just straight up stresses me tf out and harms my mental health.

I've come to terms with the fact that I simply just do not enjoy socializing, and that I don't have to feel insecure about my awkward conversational skills, my lack of close friends, etc. As long as I'm comfortable with myself and not being mean or intentionally unfriendly with anyone, then I think I'm doing fine.

I just want people to understand that there are others who genuinely thrive in solitude and may even be harmed by over-socializing.

"32","My uncle has been recording me without my knowledge, please help","2024-02-25",1708889334,"My uncle has been recording me without my knowledge, please help","Hello, I'm a 21F college student living far away from home. I've moved to a dormitory, where I've been living with a roommate. My uncle lives in the same city where my college is, and he is absent on the weekends. That's why I've asked if I can stay at his apartment, so I can stay alone a bit and relax. As an autistic person, living with a roommate is hard (mainly because of my sensory problems). He agreed, and I have stayed in his aparatment on weekends for 1,5 year. 

When living here, I've noticed that he has a lot of tablets that are constantly charging, with a view on a whole room. I found it kind of suspicious, but then noticed, that the camera isn't turned on (by that I mean it wasn't glowing), so I thought nothing of it.

But today I saw that my uncle has a new teddy bear. It was kinda weirdly positioned, and since I love true crime and I've watched some detective showes, I've decided to take a closer look at the teddy bear. And heck, my heart stopped when I've noticed it has a camera instead of an eye.

[the teddy bear](https://preview.redd.it/7nc252275skc1.jpg?width=2088&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=421a1cc82d51d43040a3ff1261715eada207d143)

[the camera](https://preview.redd.it/8h43tnge5skc1.jpg?width=2088&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=332d25c495250f201c2507d3d14356ebeb3bcb30)

The text on its shirt says in Polish: ""Teddy bears like children"".

I took it out of the shelf and it has a cable that is plugged to the laptop, which is charging and active (uncle put there a material, so it doesn't close up all the way).

[the cable in the teddy bear](https://preview.redd.it/dxw3y5ev5skc1.jpg?width=4640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=beb36ecd5be0958f90054ee22504c044fa1bf383)

&amp;#x200B;

I can't access uncle's laptop and when I tried to plug the bear to my own laptop, nothing showed up. I think it uses a special software.

Judging by the placement of the camera (not in the line of the other eye) and the yellow stitch next to the hole the cable goes out of, and because I checked out the company selling these bears and the tag on the bear and there was no information on spying bears with a camera, I'm sure he made it himself - he must have put the camera into a normal bear and he kept it active.

My uncle lives alone, no other people visit him, so he must have wanted to record me.

It's possible that he simply wanted to make sure I don't steal anything, but that's weird, I have never taken anything and I don't snoop around. Every time I leave I clean the whole apartment and even uncle once said that when I leave there are no traces, as if I was never there (bc of my perfectionism I put everything exactly in its last position). I'm a bit afraid he wants to blackmail me perhaps. He's quite old, about 65, and has two nonverbal children (that stay at his ex-wife's house) that will need a 24/7 care after he and his wife passes. He doesn't want to place them in any institution or anything. Maybe I'm paranoid, but I think that perhaps he might want me to take care of them or provide money or something so he doesn't publish the materials. I have been ocassionally changing my clothes in the living room where the bear is placed (including yesterday), and I've been perfectly right in front of its vision.

It especially hurts because in the past I was a stupid teenager in love and my ex-boyfriend has been recording me discreetly when I was talking about private, intimate things I didn't want others to know and he has been sharing them with friends and God knows who else. They've been laughing about it and making fun of me being so stupid, naive and clingy.

Guys, I'm so afraid. What should I do? Tomorrow I'm going to my therapist and I want to tell her about it. I also told my parents about it and they want to talk to my uncle so he explains himself. I don't remember how long this teddy bear has been here, I've only randomly noticed it now.

I'm still a little in shock by my last appointment I had with him. He was asking things that are going on and I mentioned I am in the process of getting diagnosed with autism since it runs in my family and I seem to have pretty much all the symptoms for it. I am also in the process of getting my son diagnosed as well.

He then proceeds to go on this 30 minute tangent all about autism and how it didn't exist before 1930. He then said that autism is straight up caused by toxins and that because we started digging up mercury and putting it in things it caused Autism. I politely told him no, people with autism were actually put in insane asylums and tortured along with other people with other mental health illnesses that weren't widely known or understood. It did exist before 1930, people just weren't smart enough to understand it and finally were able to discover what it was. I said it runs in my family. How else would I have gotten it? I believe my brother to even have autism, my dad, my grandfather, my dad's brother, my cousin, one of my cousins daughters, and I'm sure there is more. He said it's because of the mercury fillings my mother had that I came out autistic and probably the same thing for my other family members. The mercury caused brain damage and enabled my brain from developing properly. 

He even mentions that he has a friend who cures autism. I was polite and said well I've never heard of that before. His response was because there's people who don't want me to know that. You could probably picture the look on my face. Like why would people be making people have autism?? What is there to gain by possibly keeping people autistic?? His theories make zero sense. The craziest part is he literally has zero evidence to show me to prove that this is even real.

He continued by saying that if I act now I can even cure my son of autism. My response to him saying that to me was there's nothing wrong with my son and I don't need to fix him. So what? His brain is different? He is a brilliant human and I love him. I don't want to make my child fit into a society and lose himself. At this point I am shaking and I am extremely uncomfortable. I told him I feel very uncomfortable and I am going to go now. I'm still in shock.

We think the way we think for a reason. We behave the way we behave for a reason. We have the problems that we have because of Autism, not because we just need to learn coping mechanisms, alter our brain chemistry, or change our thinking patterns.¬†

**EDIT: This is a young man that likes a girl he believes is on the spectrum at his school (this claim is dubious, he has literally no proof).**

**Here are some highlights from this** ***wonderful*** **young bachelor:**

&gt;I don't want to bother this girl. But I also feel like I don't want to ""give up"" too soon. The common recreation area is a mutual special interest that attracts LOADS of crude, arrogant meatheads and **I feel like if I take things really slow and show her little by little that I'm different (literally, as in ND) and patient....do you think she might warm up to me?** I also don't want to waste my time.

This poor guy is surrounded by cHaDs, y'all. /s Neurodiversity status is not the only thing that will make someone interested in you.

&gt;Here's the catch - I am objectively better looking than her (please don't get hung up on this point.

Again, subjective. I hope she avoids him like the plague.

&gt;A few other guys in the vicinity indirectly try to get her attention by acting like fools (like NTs - self-interested, arrogant meatheads, staying grouped up because they aren't as confident being alone) but I've never seen them interact directly. I'm the only person I've seen try to talk to her.

He is literally not around this girl all times of the day. He doesn't have a clue who she interacts with, and is trying to logic his way into being more special than other people.

&gt;who is likely not too confident about her looks having some handsome guy who says stuff like ""oops, I didn't mean to bother you, enjoy your time here"" when I try starting a conversation (an NT strategy, which is why I'm looking for some ND strategies) and she withdraws and puts up a mask.

Just because he assumes she's autistic means that he's pretty sure she doesn't think of herself as pretty.

&gt;....most girls, in my experience,would say ""thanks"" or something but she just seemed, well, **autistically** reclusive about it.

There is so much to unpack here. Or she could just not like an ableist (I don't care if he's also ND, he's at a terrible intersection of being ableist *and* sexist) pompous asshole.

&gt;But I refuse to let the socially-isolating coping mechanisms be what stops me from being her friend.

I read that as, ""I don't care if you seem repulsed by me, I'm still gonna give it a good shot anyway."" Again, he's assuming that ""socially-isolating coping mechanisms"" are stopping her from liking him when... she could just think he's not attractive. Or that he's creepy. Or for any other reasons. He is, again, trying to reason his way into her pants because he's on the spectrum. He do not ""get her"" more than other people because he's on the spectrum. He literally doesn't know if she is or isn't. He needs to leave this girl alone and actually be friends with some autistic women and they'll tell him he's being a jerk.

I'm probably just going to find a new subreddit for women on the spectrum. Shit like this makes me so tired. Real sick of people asking these bad faith questions in the name of asking how they can better coerce autistic women into bed with them instead of them genuinely trying to understand.

Also that i was really argumentative and didn't want to do the exercises. And it's frustrating to teach me.

I have no idea what she's talking about. I LOVE pilates. I've done one-on-one lessons for two years. I have a chronic pain condition (ehlers danlos) and this is the most effective thing I've ever done for it. Every week, we talk about altering the exercises to suit my body, anatomy, how exercises should feel in my body vs how they really feel, and nitpicking every aspect of my form in extreme detail. This is what my body needs, because with my condition I'd be very likely to injure myself in most exercise settings. And without pilates, I injure myself constantly in day to day life. So I'm basically obsessed with pilates. It's better than physical therapy. I recommend it to everyone. I will never ever quit.

Generally, the teacher responds with new cues or consults from more experienced teachers (on video chat) or exercise modifications when I say an exercise is difficult or causing nausea/headache etc. It's not usually that I do a difficult exercise for a while and then it gets easier. It's usually that i do it in a slightly different way according to her direction, and it's instantaneously easier; and she will simultaneously comment that my form looks much better that way. I've never refused to do an exercise. We've recently been working on something that is particularly difficult for me, because I asked to focus on it.

I can only assume that this type of exchange is what she was referring to as ""negative"" and ""argumentative"". But I don't know if she's felt like this the whole two years? When we first met i told her that i recently found out I'm autistic and people sometimes think I'm rude, but I probably don't mean it and don't know I'm doing it. We have also hung out (went to restaurant/cocktail bar) 4-5 times outside of pilates, so i assumed she experienced my potential weirdness as neutral. I'm not offended that she thinks I'm negative, clearly from this sub, NTs commonly experience autistic women that way. It did hurt my feelings that she also told me that I didn't want to be there and didn't want to do the exercises. I don't think it's nice for people to tell me they know my intentions/feelings and they're negative. They should at least ask?

So I just said ""ok"". got up, got my stuff, and left before I started crying. In my experience, trying to convince people of my actually positive intentions doesn't work. So my plan is to see if I can start with a different pilates teacher instead. (Because i don't think it's a realistic plan to try to *act more normal! Forever!* Eventually it's going to come up again.) It's a really small pilates studio (she's one of 2 full time teachers and there's also 3 part time teachers), so they're definitely going to be talking about me. :( Now I'm embarrassed and so ashamed. I thought I effectively hid this autism thing by acting somewhat normal. Now i feel like they're just another clique talking about how weird i am. 

Any thoughts or suggestions? Am i overreacting? Do you think it's a good plan to switch to another pilates teacher? I would switch to another studio, but I live in a really small town and it's not an option.

Being called defensive or argumentative is irking me a lot lately, more so as close friends and family (none of them neurotypical) say it too, and I feel very misunderstood and deeply confused. 

Ill just be having a what I think is a regular conversation when all of a sudden its, youre arguing again, you always have something to say, Youre getting worked up, I feel like this is making you angry, etc. These comments seem so out of the blue to me, and leave me  confused! Cos I know Im not feeling those emotions nor do I think I am arguing. Im not disagreeing with what the person says, or trying to change their point of view at all. 

To argue can be defined as: to persuade someone to do or not to do [something] by giving reasons.
Im never trying to persuade someone (especially my close friends and family) when I share my thoughts, reasoning or evidence for my logic on a topic. I dont assume others are trying to persuade me if they disagree and tell me the information they have on the topic. Legitimately sounds like a good, stimulating conversation to me. What am I giving off that people assume Im trying to persuade them or assert that I am right? Or maybe its that they think I am suggesting that they are wrong by mentioning additional or diverging information? 

Its deffo annoying me extra at the moment, but a lifelong thing people have said to me, and Im always confused. Comments that sting are like, You should be a lawyer& in response to me answering a question as clearly as I could. Particularly when asked a Yes No question, which I do not have a Yes No answer for, Ive noticed.

Im so confounded by these critiques. No one can seem to tell me what it is Im doing or not doing that gives this impression. Especially sucks to hear Im being argumentative when I felt like we were having a great chat about [topic]. I just dont get it! I dont want to give off an aggressive or contrary energy at all.

I mean wasnt every kid looking for dogs and cats falling out of the sky during a rainstorm? What she did for me is give me a character that felt familiar. I felt I was laughing with her and not at her. And representations matters. She always meant to do well and be kind to others. The characters learnt to be patient with her. I also felt like the following book she was appreciated for what she could do well. Telling stories about autistic characters will always be messy because to be truthful it cannot escape ableism. Its present in our everyday lives. I like honesty and think we shouldnt shy away but talk about it. Thoughts?

I always lie about disabilities on job applications, I don't think that would change with me getting a diagnosis lol.

I guess I just don't trust the system, getting an autism diagnosis just seems like it'd be an extra target on my back. The benefits aren't worth it, if self diagnosis upsets some people I don't really care. The same people wouldn't support me with a diagnosis either, their aggression would just present differently.

People who dont know me very well often tell me I need to step out of my comfort zone, usually when I refuse to do something or go somewhere I know would likely lead to a meltdown. I have always considered this terrible advice. Why would I want to step out of the manageable zone and into the acute distress zone? So today, while waiting for a train, I realised that comfort zone does not mean manageable zone. When I stepped into that train I was quite literally stepping into a zone I was uncomfortable in, but it wasnt unmanageable.

The point Im trying to say is that people who recommend this never realised how small my comfort zone actually is, and as a result, neither did I. I was already outside of it while speaking with them. I leave my comfort zone almost every single day. But of course, most people arent aware of this. They have no way of knowing that the fun they suggest or the place they recommend wouldnt be any fun for me.

We were in a friend's house for a gathering. It was someone I hadn't met before.

Now, to be clear, what I *really* meant when I asked if he wanted something to drink, was..... did he want something to drink.

""I don't drink."" He had replied, slightly annoyed.

So I'm thinking, omg, how long can a human survive without liquids. I'm trying to remember, but I'm pretty sure it's a matter of days, not like, you can just go without drinking anything ever. But then I remembered I had worked in an office with a lady who said she never drank water, but she drank multiple cups of tea and coffee - and she said her urine output was not healthy. But this guy said he didn't drink, at all. Maybe he meant that he just ate a LOT of fruit and veggies - I remember reading that when you are trying to figure out how many cups of water you drink per day, that you can take into account that you get liquids from other sources. Some veggies have a very high water content, like cucumbers are supposedly over 90% water. So now I'm thinking, does he just eat a crap ton of cucumbers every day. But surely, like SURELY he has to drink something, like juice or milk.... maybe he has a medical condition, an injured trachea or something and he can't swallow liquids, but that didn't seem to be it either...

Anyway, I was stuck in that confused reverie for a bit too long, and I guess while I was thinking these things and trying to figure out how he gets through life without drinking \*anything\* - I had been continuously staring at him blankly.

Which he took as me judging him, and he then got angry and went on a big rant like ""YOU KNOW IT'S OKAY TO HAVE FUN WITHOUT ALCOHOL - ugh, why do people always have such a f\*@king issue when I don't want to get drunk all the time?""

And that's when I realized that he thought I was trying to offer him alcohol.

Yet the first time I did a lil online quiz about Autism and it said that autistic people miss social cues, I was like nahh I TOTALLY get social cues, too easy, of course I understand social cues, pfff that's a silly question..... until this year when I thought, 'but what ARE social cues?'

My theory - and maybe you wont agree - is that NT men in general dont mind weirdness as much. In my experience it takes a LOT of weird to put a man off. Women, on the other hand, are pretty low tolerance about that stuff. They dont have a secret meeting or anything, but they do decide to just go nope and exclude you. 

To tell you truthfully, I can name several NT men who made me feel like my weirdness was either just not there, or not something to be ashamed off.

I just needed to vent,  please let me know if I need more TWs.

I'm a black woman recently diagnosed and it just upsets me the way some NT white women have taken advantage of me and completely demonized me because I didn't speak or act to their standards.

I don't know how to be passive aggressive and am quick to call people out for bad behavior. I'm very direct when I speak and, even though I struggle with boundaries, once I can establish a boundary,  its a firm one. 

In the past I've had white women become my friend with the intention of changing me. They ignore my boundaries and gaslight me until I think and speak like them. They think they are helping me but it actually just makes me mask harder and feel ashamed and broken. They've literally tried to correct my thinking pattern and police my words before I say them.

When I finally hit my limit and say no,  they cry and tell people I'm being rude to them and treat me like I'm this big intimidating bully. I wasn't a bully when you violated my space, told me how to speak, how to dress, where to eat etc. You weren't scared of me when I did everything you told me and bent over backwards catering to your needs. 

Now that I say no, I'm a monster and everyone needs to know? And the worst part is that other NT white women are quick to believe her and hate me without any evidence. They treat me like an abuser when my own therapist has to push me to stop letting people take advantage of me. Its hard because if I try to be firm on anything,  I'm hit with such aggressive backlash that I feel like a monster. 

I wanna reiterate that I love white people and have white friends (they are ND and queer). I just realized that I had a pattern with some NT white women and it made me upset.","AutismInWomen",237,"https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismInWomen/comments/12lyb83/how_white_nt_women_treat_us/"

* Allowed headphones or earbuds anytime I wasn't actively lecturing
* Provided some noise-cancelling headphones
* Allowed hats/food/doodling/whatever didn't actually cause a problem as long as they did their work

I knew nothing explicitly about autism or neurodivergence in general (you would think teachers have at least an overview course, esp since we are often the first ones to flag kids for issues); I just knew that I wanted my kids to learn and I did NOT want a fear-based classroom. I wanted my kids to be free and comfortable. I just tried to respond to their needs as I understood them, and to not impose arbitrary restrictions. I know so much more now, and would design a better classroom, but I'm not sure I could handle going back to teaching full-time. Looking back, though, I feel pretty good about a lot of the things I did as a teacher. I did what came naturally and felt kids needed more of, and I now realize a huge part of these choices came from my own experiences.

I left full-time teaching and have been substitute teaching this year while I figure out what's next. I'm seeing inside 'normal' public middle schools and high schools for the first time in my life.... Holy shit schools are oppressive. Holy shit. I did not go to a typical middle school and high school, myself. My school was an alternative school and was much more free, it was cool to be 'weird'. (Now I realize we likely had a very high proportion of ND kids). Public education is an amazing gift, AND we can do better.

I don't fully know the point of this post. It's just one more life reflection I'm doing now that I finally am aware of my autism, and what it can mean to be autistic. Thanks for reading. And to anyone still in school in a place that is forcing you to hide away and smother parts of yourself - I feel for you. You are stuck in an abusive system and YOU are not the problem.

**Edit:** Wow, you all are really giving this depressed woman a serious mood lift. Thank you for your kind words. &lt;3  Thank you for sharing your own schooling experiences. I believe we can change things. We have power. Love to all of you.

**Edit:** I want to make clear that what I described above isn't possible in all classes or schools.  Nor is it a comprehensive list, or even exactly what I would do today. It's just some things I remembered in a new light after learning about my own autism and decided to share. This post has resonated with a lot of people and got a lot of attention, though. So I need to state explicitly: If a class runs differently, in a way that is harder for you, it's not necessarily because a teacher is uncaring in some way. We are touching on a larger system that is flawed, within a larger society. If you look into the history of public school in the US, you will learn it was never designed with human development in mind; it was explicitly designed to enforce class divide and groom workers. Explicitly. This is the historical legacy. This is the system we enter into as students and teachers. Most teachers are doing the best they can every day.","AutismInWomen",70,"https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismInWomen/comments/u378ri/things_i_did_in_my_classroom_as_an_undiagnosed/"

At social gatherings, some guy and I will be talking about what we do for work or whatnot, and at some point, the conversation just nosedives when we get to THIS topic: for example, when I moved from small town California to San Francisco for college back in the 2000s, my older male cousin asked me what kinds of parties I go to and how wasted do I get. I thought that was an incredibly gross thing to ask, and I said in an annoyed tone that I don't party. He was incredulous, and even seemed annoyed. He kept poking at the subject until he could get the answer he apparently wanted from me - I snapped back, ""it's an art school, it's not that kind of college"". He asked me if I go to artist parties then, where we draw naked people. I couldn't believe the difference in our mental maturity - I was 18 and he was like, 26? I walked away.

On another occasion, I was working on a team project when a guy in my team asked me what my favorite bars/clubs are in the city, and when I said that I don't go to any, he said, ""are you where fun goes to die?""

And the latest occurrence was at a company dinner just a month ago, where I sat with some coworkers I hadn't spoken to before. I had moved to LA and flew back down to the bay area for this event, so this guy was asking me what I liked about LA, and I was happy to share - I love surfing, hiking, concerts, the culture, the food. Then he added - ""and the parties? I bet you go to a lot of them down there, huh?"" I replied no, I don't party. Same stupid incredulous ""NO WAY"" face that my cousin gave me all those years ago. He just wouldn't drop it - ""come on, really?? No way?? There's gotta be some place you like, come on. Don't you drink? (no) What do you do for fun?"" I JUST told you - I surf, I hike, I go to rock shows, that's what I do for fun. Why the frick is this so important to you?? And for fox sake, we're all in our 30s and 40s here. Grow up?

I spent the majority of my life to appeal to the beauty standards (I'm 29 now). Having a body that's not naturally slim, being prone to acne and of course being easily overstimulated by sensory input made this an uphill battle.

But still, to me being pretty meant being safe. Being accepted. Belonging to somebody. So I did it without questioning.

My family hugely added to this issue. When I was a little girl I used to get dressed up for annual photoshootings to make calendars for the whole family, make up and all. Every family member casually made a comment on my appearance whenever they saw fit throughout my whole life and it was pretty much several times daily. I got shamed for gaining weight, shamed for wearing too much make up, not putting enough effort in, looking too casual, looking too preppy... *(I cut contact to them this year, for a multitude of reasons.)*

I thought my looks were absolutely necessary to have friends and find love. I also had a toxic mindset myself and judged people who didn't try to fit into those beauty standards as lazy and lackluster. And felt intimidated by and even hostile towards other women who were better than me in fitting into those standards.

Not anymore.

I now have a boyfriend, we live together since 2.5 years, and when he first told me he wouldn't mind me having a buzzcut, no make up, and extra weight (things I all asked him about on several occasions when spiraling into appearance linked anxiety). That he even liked it and thought it's beautiful, as long as it's me. I didn't believe him, even judged him as being somehow perverted (that's how engrained this toxic beauty mindset was).

But quarantine and traumatic events in my life made their choice for me. I fell into a deep depression and wouldn't move for months, all the while eating junk food, so I gained weight. I lost the capacity to care for my long hair, so I shaved it off. And still having to do shopping for groceries to not starve, I went into public wearing non-matching clothing that just happened to lie around and still fit me, even not wearing a bra because none of them would fit me anymore either - biggest insecurity for me having a bigger cup size. And no make up, because I lacked the energy for that, too. I was extremely anxious and stressed the first times, I felt like inviting the whole world to humiliate me. Like walking around with no armour.

I now look like teenage-me worst nightmare. And I decided to love it. My hair had grown out a little, and I wanted to shave it all of again three days ago, but then on an impulse cut a mohawk and now I love how wild it looks. Like a hyena. (They're one of my favorite animals.)

After studying beauty standards for all these years, of course my brain still fires ""UGLY UGLY UGLY"" often when I look in the mirror, and old fears arise and I also cried more than I want to admit over being the way I am now.

But the other part of me feels like it can breathe for the first time. Yesterday I ordered myself some oversized men shirts to wear. Because it's comfy. Because it's now about how it feels for me, not how it looks to others. No more itchy lace bras, no more irritating jeans, no more applying make up in a panic because ""what will people think of me"", no more blisters from high heels.

Accepting fat, mohawk, bra-less, barefaced me is my new goal. I choose ugly. I choose comfy. I choose the me that comes without strenuous effort. Because I deserve to relax. And it also makes me feel like a huge badass, intentionally staying outside of the beauty standards that once dictated my whole life and learning to embrace the ugly instead of being afraid of it.

Sorry if this sounds condescending to anyone who likes beauty stuff - I'm still in the process of sorting inner me and right now it more feels like a battle I have to successfully win day after day. Triumphant in a way, but still a battle and not complete inner peace, because it's all so new. So please know any hostility is aimed against parts within me. I aim to be free of judgement regarding anyone's appearance, mine as well as others, and am in the middle of the process of unlearning a lifelong toxic mindset.

ive been dating this guy for over a year now and things have been rough& mainly because my autism has been getting worse compared to when we first met.

i told him i am autistic early on but i dont think he realized how autistic i am or how much it disables me in life. i was able to heavily mask back then but now i struggle to at all.

we went on a trip to another state to visit his family recently. 
i was stuck at a new house with a bunch of new people for a whole week and it really stressed me out. 
on top of that his family was super unaccommodating. they didnt bother making meals i could eat and i ended up with digestive issues. 
they were also super ableist and constantly used the r-slur and mocked kids they thought had autism. 

as you could imagine i was pretty terrified they would notice my autism.
 i became incredibly anxious while interacting with them.

because of this i had at least one meltdown every day (plus they lasted much longer than usual)

i was expecting to have trouble with this trip and warned my bf beforehand that i would have meltdowns and might need some extra support from him.

after the first few days i could tell my meltdowns were really starting to annoy/tire my bf.

he tried to be there for a bit but i think my disability exhausts him.
he slowly stopped trying to be there for me and instead left me by myself in our room to cry for hours.

then he started to initiate sex during my meltdowns pretty frequently. 
this is something he has done before but it became more obvious on this trip because i had so many meltdowns.

the problem is that i am not thinking clearly or as able to communicate when i have meltdowns. 

i have told my bf this before. 

whenever he attempted to have sex with me during a meltdown i would always go along with it. 
it felt like i was on autopilot and then afterwards when everything settled down and i could think again&i just felt gross

i am now realizing that i dont know if im  capable of consenting during meltdowns because it puts me in a very childish and emotional mindset where i cant really process anything and it feels like i barely know whats going on around me because im so overwhelmed.

 i think he might realize this and be turned on by the fact that hes taking advantage of me. 
he just seemed too eager to have sex when i was crying and shaking on the floor.
i know he likes to be controlling in the bedroom and i feel like he is aroused by the amount of control he can have over me when i am having a meltdown.

now that im back home by myself and away from everything that happened ive been reflecting a lot on the trip 

im just really scared that ive been taken advantage of this whole time without realizing it until now.

my whole relationship with him its been a pattern. he always tries to have sex when i am crying or upset and seems to take sadistic joy in it.

he even threatened to break up with me in the car and then started initiating sex with me the second we got back to my house as i was still breaking down crying

he shows zero signs of empathy a majority of the time, and im starting to think its because he actually takes pleasure in my pain.","AutismInWomen",228,"https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismInWomen/comments/11exkj3/is_sex_during_a_meltdown_rape_tw_possible_sa/"

Some say that it's because we've had to look into ourselves a lot more than most other NTs and discover this part of ourselves when others may be in denial or actually do not realize their multisexuality. 

Some say that, going with the philosophy that people in general are naturally bisexual, we didn't naturally pick up the societal cues and preferences to be straight from a young age, and it seemed (and is) irrational when we learnt of homophobia later on; so we've not been conditioned to lean towards being straight and accepted our attraction to other ladies.

TL;DR: I just had the worst customer service experience of my life for trying to fly with a single bird. [Southwest Airlines]

For those of you who dont know, Southwest Airlines has a pet policy which only includes cats and dogs. My male pigeons wife recently died, so instead of having him be taken care of by roommates for a month, I decided to call Southwest and see if I would be able to take him if he was in a cat carrier.

What is the first thing you do if you feel that the answer on a website isnt giving you a totally cohesive understanding of a policy? You call, right? So I called the airline (as you need to reserve a spot for pets anyways) and told them I had a bird. The woman on the phone said there was only a box for cats or dogs, but agreed to check Cat and I could see what they said when I got to the airport, as she didnt know anything more specific about the pet policy.

I got to the airport, went to the help desk, had my transparent carrier sitting in full view with him while I went through the process with the staff, there was no issue, they tagged him and sent me to security. At security, they had me take him out of the carrier and dusted my hands, usual protocol, he did great! A number of the security even petted him and asked me questions.

Im sitting in the boarding area with him and 20 minutes before boarding, a woman comes up to me and asks what I have in the crate. I say its my bird, and she says yeah, that things not coming on the plane. Youre not boarding this flight. Im like wtf, I both called and went through service with him and there were NO problems whatsoever. Whats going on? She then calls over her supervisor who suggests that I just have someone come get him and wait for a different southwest flight. I tell him I purchased a ticket which specifies that same-day I can transfer to another flight going to the same city, can I do that? He says only southwest flights, which obviously doesnt help the situation at all. Also, the same-day transfer policy on the website in no way specifies this as far as I can tell. I tell him its kind of absurd that I was checked through this whole process and no one found an issue with me bringing him. He says its not our issue, you should have never gotten in here, as though its somehow not their issue even though they openly admitted multiple checkpoints of Southwests staff failed.

I tell him to just refund me, Im not flying without him. The entire time hes just sitting there not making a peep. This conversation is taking place in the middle of a crowded boarding area, so obviously everyone is watching and listening. Both the woman and her supervisor just loudly keep reminding me that I should have checked the policy online (to which I keep replying that I literally did!) and that I should have never been allowed in here as though Im some kind of delinquent who wandered in without a ticket.

I rebook to a same day flight on United, and I cry a little bit tbh bc at this point the whole situation is feeling pretty overwhelming and humiliating and people are pointing and whispering, etc-the ticket is obviously hugely, hugely expensive bc its a same day flight. I go to the counter and ask if there is someone I can talk to about this, just to try to understand how this happened in the first place, and the girl at the counter just keeps repeating you already talked to my supervisor. I say, you understand why this is kind of upsetting though, right? Im just trying to understand. You already talked to my supervisor, theres nothing more I can do. I ask if theres a way I can file a complaint. You have to just go on the website.

I sit down next to the counter to try to handle all of this new information, and calm down a bit. I get up to the counter and apologize to the two women who I dealt with earlier if I came across as cross (which I really was not being rude or loud or anything, if Im being honest, but I was raised to be pretty anti confrontational) and the woman just coldly replies well, you should have checked the policies beforehand. Im seriously taken aback and go I am not trying to get anything from you, I am just trying to let you know I know this is your job and I am sorry if I came across as terse. She rolls her eyes and says yeah, well you know you should have checked the policies before buying a ticket, right? Its okay, I get it, I know checking these things beforehand is confusing in a way that very clearly meant to imply that I was stupid for not checking. I did check, I called. Well you need to check online next time.

There are two kickers here: one is that when I went to sit down to text my family etc, the adult women behind the counter began mocking me and making fun of my situation, talking about how ridiculous peoples lies were and why wasnt I leaving and how did I think I was getting away with this and mocking me for bringing a bird. Right in front of my face. They could see me! I was right next to them! Hello! Im not a ghost!

The second was that not even ten minutes before this all occurred, I filled out Southwests customer survey because one of the staff offered me a tablet and asked me to. The best part? I gave them 5 stars and noted that they had excellent and smooth pet service. >&<√ª
@ 

I sent in a complaint email to southwest, asking if they could comp some or all of the price difference for having to buy a same day ticket, and only got a form letter back. I called them, and got told there was nothing further they could do. The woman wouldnt even acknowledge the mocking part. Im sorry for this long post, but I genuinely feel kind of humiliated and confused as to how everyone in this situation could lack so much human empathy. For the record, my boy was an absolute angel the entire time (which ended up being like 9 hours because of the delays) At least I had him to comfort me.","AutismInWomen",89,"https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismInWomen/comments/173y22o/southwest_airlines_staffed_openly_mocked_me_and/"

Problem is my dad is a dick. Ive railed about this on various subs. Ive railed about the misogyny in autism on this sub itself. I posit that men are more allowed to be autistic, to have autistic traits; that they are diagnosed on average much earlier and are often babied for it; and that women get the opposite.

Anecdotal evidence: check autistic subs versus womens autistic subs. Women are constantly asking: I have a problem with abc because of my sensory issues; how can I remedy this? versus mens Im worthless and useless because of autism and will never get a girlfriend. In a way, I think the babying doesnt help them; with others, they are allowed to sit in their computer room and clackety clack all day, while women are thought of as weirdos for that.

I work in marketing. Sales side. We hired a few new people in I think august, one of whom is Emily (name changed). Ive become very, very close with her pretty much right away. Of course, her husband is autistic; we bonded over that. We both struggle with mental and physical health and have chronic illness. Shes a lovely human being and has a lot to offer ANYONE. And I dont say that lightly.

She married him ten years ago with the promise from him that they will have a kid or kids one day. Each year he put it off. Then he dropped a bomb. I dont want kids with you because of your mental health.

This man that withholds any emotional support; doesnt pay attention to his wife when shes ill (she has multiple sclerosis for fucks sake, that is a HUGE DEAL!), who gaslights her when shes sick (she had serotonin syndromealso HUGE DEAL and potentially deadlyand he just thought she was nuts and making a big deal out of it!!!); and is generally emotionally unavailable in every way, shape or form. This man reminds me of my father, who excelled in business because of his straight up aggression, but hasnt excelled in anything else. What does my dad have? Some cash. What doesnt he have? Everything else.

This man lied to my friend about having a kid. There are many tip-offs that show that he never wanted one anyway. Then he blames it on her instability. Yes, she has mental health issues, but this woman gets out of bed no matter what and throws everything into her work. She bends over backwards for all of her friends and would give someone the shirt off her back. She has her bad days and trucks through them like I do because she doesnt want anyone to think her weak. She has raised this mans daughter (her step daughter) wholeheartedly and is proud of it. And he puts the blame on her: I wont have a baby with you because you have depression and trauma and anxiety. Its your fault.

Total cop-out. Yes, she admits she acted unstable when she had serotonin syndrome (which can be incredibly deadly, so uh, she gets a big old pass from me.) and he gaslit her so that she wouldnt get treatment, because of course shes just being dramatic. My friend, who feels bad all the time like I do, who goes into work on her worst days and sucks it up because she has a pathological need to fulfill her responsibilities. Yeah, so dramatic. /s

Im mad. It made me livid to hear this. It made me see red to hear her tell me things hes said that are pretty much identical to how my dad acts.

Men, autism isnt an excuse to be totally emotionally inept. I know, its hard. We dont naturally know how to respond to these situations. But youve been allowed to act like dicks because its a man thing to do. We were forced to LEARN, as women, as social creatures. 

And so ends another rant about the differences between autistic men and women. I hope nothing struck a bad chord in anyone; if so, let me know.

The producers/directors were absolutely fantastic the whole time, and clearly cared about my own comfort to the extent I was invited watch the final cut and veto anything I didn't want included on TV. This meant I could see myself from another perspective for the first time...

I spend a LOT of my time worrying about what other people think of me and how I might be perceived. Am I using the right body language? Facial expressions? Is the mask convincing? So it was a bit of a shock when I discovered that I am clearly not as good as it as I thought. I went undiagnosed into my 20s, and I cannot BELIEVE nobody pointed out my weird body language or facial expressions before then. 

Seriously... I side-eye other people, seem inappropriately serious during light hearted discussion, have a weird resting face, I hold my arms really oddly like I'm pushing an imaginary shopping cart, walk very carefully and deliberately and fiddle with my hands constantly. I was very surprised. After all, I knew there were cameras there so I was trying extra hard to come off as neurotypical! 

Because I'm openly autistic in the documentary I decided not to request anything be cut even though some things made me cringe a little. I want to be authentic. It's going to air soon and I'm really pleased with the way my story is presented. 

I'm not sure what I can take away from this. It should probably be: life is too short to put so much effort into masking because it doesn't work anyway. But part of me is really disappointed in my apparent lack of talent doing something I've been aiming to perfect for over two decades... Ugh!

I want to be empathetic, but the way this article is worded is... Strange. Frankly, I really do not like what it seems to be implying.

It explains the reason for the name is because of the mythological Cassandra who could see and predict the future, but no one believed her. They say that's what it is like to be married to an ""Aspie"", because nobody believes the NT partner about how hard it is to be married to someone who ""deprives them emotionally"".

They basically say that the NT partner develops a ""rare form of complex-PTSD"" from not being able to communicate adequately with their ND spouse. That they basically are constantly gaslit because they can ""see reality"" but their partner does not.

To me this sounds... Kind of like they're describing exactly what it's like to be autistic? But claiming it only happens to NT people who marry autistic people? And the entire thing is just about how difficult and awful it is to be married to someone like me, and how much the NT partner suffers. And I don't want to deny anyone else's experiences, I'm sure it's extremely hard, going through constant communication issues is indeed horrible and even traumatic, but... Is it not a two-way street? Is the ND partner not also suffering if communication is so poor within the partnership?

I'm just wondering if anyone has heard of this before and can help me understand. It's making me feel really bad about myself, but maybe I just need someone who is actually autistic to explain it to me better.

I'm talking about interacting with a particular type of women, often when there are two or more of them present (typically in a workplace enviroment like the hairdresser's, dentist, or an office) and you feel especially ""perceived"" or judged by them. There's some side-eye between them after you've spoken, as if they're silently agreeing ""yeah, I know, she's weird..."" or if they're less obviously Mean Girling at you then it's more that they're stiff and awkward with you in a noticeably different way than they are with all other women in the environment. It's like a low-key exclusionary tactic which I recognise first experiencing in school, starting about age 9 when most of the girls suddenly became very invested in forming groups and being perceived as ""cool"".

They seem to have a strong sense of group identity and to value fitting in above being inclusive or kind. They also tend to look and behave very heteronormatively, so since I've started to be visibly more non-binary I feel like the physical part of my masking has slipped (I use she/they pronouns and do feel connected to femininity, just not in a neurotypical or straight way).

They do stuff like the ""elevator eyes"" (just learned this phrase today!) where they flick their gaze up and down you in an assessing way, or they stare at you for a few beats too long after you've spoken, and then smile for the benefit of another woman in their in-group and say ""Anyway..."" before changing the subject to something they think is more appropriate (I don't bring up inappropriate stuff, but I can tell I've wandered off from the script they were expecting or I'm making terrible eye contact and they don't know how to interact, so they just do a conversation reset and try to sweep me and all my neurospicy mess away).

It's honestly been one of the most hurtful aspects of my life, feeling so judged and rejected by groups of women who seem to be everywhere, inescapably part of my life.

Some members dont even bother to read the book! Whats going on here? The difference is for Ally, reading is a special interest and for everyone else, this is a social interest.

Special interests are often not a point of connection for us. Special interests tend to be more of a means of connecting with ourselves. They can be intensely personal, and when youre deeply passionate about something you might get deeply when someone expresses an opinion you know is \*\*clearly wrong\*\* and you can wind up in a heated argument over something that is inconsequential to most people. Special interests often arent a great connection point.

I give slightly modified advice which is adopt a social interest. A social interest is something you like well enough, but you mainly do it because it puts you in a room with other people. For example, one of the most common social interests NT children adopt is sports. A lot of kids like sports not because theres something magical about running around and throwing balls, they like being on a team and the thrill of a collective win. As adults, knowing about sports can often be a conversation starter.

My social interests are badminton and astrology (EDIT: yes, I do mean astrology and not astronomy, please reserve your judgments if you have any.) Im not passionate about badminton, but Im ok at it and my friend keeps inviting me to play, so I do. I also like astrology because if Im in a group full of women I dont know well, I can almost always say something about the sky and then the conversation gets started. My special interest is aerial silk, and I only subject my husband to infodumps about that.

Anyway, I hope this de-mystifies a few socialization struggles for someone. Much love!","AutismInWomen",79,"https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismInWomen/comments/y71rwz/special_vs_social_interests_aka_why_make_friends/"

Now that Ive read so many experiences here, I definitely see myself in them. And I realized that its because the descriptions are all what we look like to a NT observing us from the outside. 

For example, Lines up objects sounds weird to me because who the heck just places objects in a line for no reason?? But from my internal experience, what Im doing with those objects is thinking about what different orders they could best be in that reflects their different traits. 

Another example is sees patterns in things, like if that supposed to mean I hallucinate geometric shapes superimposed over reality?? But what I think the internal experience of that description is trying to say is that I can see the connections between concepts that others might miss, which leads me to creative solutions to problems

And this isnt surprising because we have a hard time knowing how we come off to people (isnt that that lack of Theory of Mind part of autism?), so how would we be able to see ourselves in those clinical descriptions?

Same thing with ADHD, I had no idea I was AuDHD because I dont identify with stares off into space, or makes careless mistakes, because thats not what my internal experience is. 

TLDR: I wish there were Autism tests that had descriptions/examples of what it actually feels like to experience autistic traits, rather than what a NT observing us from the outside sees.","AutismInWomen",355,"https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismInWomen/comments/1882gfh/is_there_a_description_of_autistic_traits_from/"

It is very common for autistic women to be ADHD and not actually realise it. The reason for this is that we tend to do well in school, maybe we're organised 'type A' kids, and rule oriented, so we're rarely badly behaved.

Though we may (or may not) be quite chatty by autistic standards, we probably don't 'seem' ADHD to NT people. Oftentimes hyperactivity is internalised in adulthood and experienced by the individual as anxiety or inner restlessness.

It is also common for autistic women to have 'inattentive type' ADHD, especially in comparison to the average population, which might make you more of a day-dreamer but without the same restlessness.

One way you can tell you have ADHD is that you often find yourself unable to do something you feel you should being doing, unless either 1) you actually want to do it, you're enthusiastic about it, or 2) you're so terrified by the thought of the impending deadline that your anxiety compels you to do it (often at the last minute).

The main reason I wanted to share is that the ADHD medication can be quite helpful for a lot of what people (even sometimes clinicians) tend to assume is executive functioning issues, especially if none of the classic ADHD behavioural markers seem to be present. Chronic depression, especially dysthymia, can also be another good pointer.

Autistic ADHD people probably don't look like non-autistic ADHD people so it's possible you're not identifying yourself by the stereotypes. It's worth googling a list of symptoms in adults, especially adults on the spectrum.

Hope it helps someone (because if it helps one person, it will probably REALLY make a difference in that person's life, and my time was well spent here). Thanks for listening.

1. The unwanted attention. I think this is a problem for women in general, because men. But its like I have to mentally prepare myself for social interaction and I hate being approached or cat called by men, I feel so put on the spot and it gives me so much anxiety. I dont know how to respond and I find it so awkward rejecting someone its like I feel embarrassed for them even tho they probably dont even care. Its like Im just trying to go about my day please dont look at me or talk to me stranger.

2. People not believing Im autistic, I think this is even worse because Im so good at masking. Im so used to hearing but you dont look autistic like ok?? or straight up just thinking Im lying for attention or something. Its not like we look a certain way, people are so uneducated on the matter =- 
If I act weird or something Im cute and quirky like no I generally need help in this social situation.

3.  Friends getting jealous or thinking Im flirting when Im not. Like no I dont know how to flirt, this is just me being me, Im sorry I wont look at your man next time. Ive honestly lost friends over this many times. Even just men thinking Im flirting and trying to make a move and then me being gobsmacked when theyre like but you have me so many signs

4. People thinking Im stuck up or rude. Im not quiet because I think Im better than you, believe me. I just dont know what to say or that Im supposed to be talking in this situation and Im shy. I always get saying this after were close, like when I first met you I thought xyz but youre actually really nice, or people starting to act funny around me because they think that and I struggle making friends because of it (among other things Im sure lol) 

5. People staring at me. Like I get it, I look at people I find pretty too. But I start to think Im doing something wrong or I look weird and start to spiral when theyre probably just thinking something nice.

&gt;  
&gt;""We have to be there by four.""

If I wondered when we had to be there, I would ask when we have to be there! What I asked was *when we are leaving,* which is, you might notice, a different question entirely.  


&gt;""When are you going to be finished?"" // ""I have a few tasks left.""  
&gt;  
&gt;""What food are they serving?"" // ""Don't worry, you'll like it!""  
&gt;  
&gt;""How cold is it outside?"" // ""I'd wear a sweater.""

I think the reason this happens is because of the neurotypical urge to look for subtext. Like, they're not answering the question you asked, they're trying to reverse engineer the question to figure out *why* you asked and address that directly. Except assumptions are often wrong. *I* know why I'm asking, I know what question to ask to get the information I need, I don't need you to do it for me. 

And it comes off as infantilizing too. Asking ""what is the dress code?"" and being answered ""you'll be fine in t-shirt and jeans"" might convey the information that it's a casual dress code, sure, but it's also someone trying to dictate what I should wear, as if I couldn't possibly choose correctly on my own if I was just told what the dress code was. 

I vividly remember asking my mom what time we were leaving for a friend's house, and her answer was ""don't worry, I'll take you."" I wasn't asking because I needed to arrange transport, I asked because I needed to know when to get dressed. It took control out of my hands and forced me to rely on her.

I always just repeat the question (""ok, but when are we *leaving?"")* and it usually does the trick. I just hate that so many people's first instinct is to do that to me.

I did have a talk with my husband and managed to find my words. Initially he didn't understand how this sentence could have been wrong.

1. Hyperlexia
2. Wishing for validation

In the case of hyperlexia, I learned I have a type of brain where I need to process things through language. I also learned many autistic people need to function in this way. 

I then learned that a major driver of what I thought was wanting to talk to people was in fact just the need to verbally process. I found this can often be done just as effectively through writing privately as it can talking with people. Often more effectively.

In the case of wishing for validation, I learned I have habitually sought reassurance what I am doing is acceptable as a means to avoid negative reactions, something also common among autistic people. 

I since learned, or rather came to accept, that because I am atypical I will almost certainly never get positive reactions from the majority no matter what I do. I also now understand the reason for all those negative reactions is simply due to my being atypical, not my doing anything wrong, 

As such, there's no reason to pointlessly seek validation that will never come, and is not required anyway.

Since addressing these two things the amount of genuine loneliness I feel has dropped to about 10% of what it was before. 

I have felt much less sadness as a result, so I wanted to share in case any of you might find the same thing.","AutismInWomen",63,"https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismInWomen/comments/zpl6p0/you_should_know_that_some_of_your_loneliness/"

My father left when I was a baby and my mother spent a long time absolutely disdaining me. I partially grew up in foster care and none of my foster parents liked me either. Everyone was fine with my brother but seemed to think there was something absolutely rotten about me. And I never understood because I didn't break rules or lie or sneak around. I thought I was an easy child. I still get comments from people that say I ""must've been difficult to raise"" and it hurts every time. 

It finally clicked for me today; because I couldn't bring myself to lie or break rules, I would endlessly argue about rules that didn't make sense to me. *In situations where a normal kid would've just broken the damn rule and often gotten away with it*, I made it my guardian's problem instead. To no end unless the rule either changed or made sense to me. Because agreeing to something that didn't make sense or that I knew I wouldn't be able to stick to (my foster parents put a time limit on my showers that wasn't long enough for me to wash my hair, for example) genuinely never would've even crossed my mind. I didn't realize it was a possibility. I didn't realize that other kids did it all the time. 

My mom has always struggled with the ""parenting"" part of being a mother and to this day struggles to understand that setting boundaries is sometimes the kind thing to do, and she hated conflict. So she let me talk her out of a lot and would then go behind my back telling people that I was a nightmare child, that she didn't stand a chance against me, and that I was extremely manipulative. And other people believed her and treated me accordingly. 

I overheard it sometimes and it made me cry so much. After I became an adult I found letters she wrote to my psychiatric care team warning them that I manipulated everyone into agreeing with me. All because I argued when things didn't make sense to me and wouldn't stop explaining my point of view long after people were sick of hearing about it. Because the alternative felt like lying and I didn't know how to do that. 

I still feel like shit thinking about it. I never wanted to be a bad child.","AutismInWomen",79,"https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismInWomen/comments/1behbk1/coming_to_understand_why_i_was_a_difficult_child/"

We texted a lot leading up to that date, including her being very open about her mental health struggles and current obstacles. I consoled and supported her, and shared that I was similarly finding myself after an unexpected, mid-30s  ASD diagnosis. She responded with this:

""(unrelated misunderstanding before this.)...I'm also wary of dating folks with autism diagnoses because I a) taught children with autism and now have trouble seeing people with autism as romantic interests or sexual partners and b) dated a person who was undiagnosed and I was really annoyed in conversation a lot of the time.""

I replied that I don't think this is a good fit for me, either, as this generalized abelism isn't something I want in a relationship. She claimed she wasn't abelist and that there was more context on her being traumatized by an autistic partner in the past, but, ugh.

I was so hoping that queer, leftist, pro-marginalized peoples' rights would be better dating partners than the cis straight dudes I'd mostly dealt with in the past, and this one really took the wind out of me. Combined with the shocking finale of The Ultimatum Queer Edition, I just feel like I can't trust anybody as a romantic partner ever again.

EDIT: Adding a bit down here because a lot of folks are saying I need to accept her trauma and move on. I completely agree, trauma is trauma and nobody owes anyone else their time and energy when they don't want to give it for whatever reason. She is perfectly entitled to choose her partners carefully. My problem with the exchange is that she gave me two, unprovoked, abelist reasons on why my diagnosis makes me undatable to her. Only when I said I don't want to engage with someone who feels so comfortable sharing such abelist views did she then, again unprovoked, trauma dump on me about past sexual abuse.

None of that should have happened, she had every right to say an ASD partner was off limits for her due to past experiences. My issue is the abelism and the using me as emotional support and then balking at my very first mention of my own struggles, not at all with her honoring any traumatic avoidances she has.","AutismInWomen",172,"https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismInWomen/comments/145cala/dumped_just_before_first_date_for_mentioning_im/"

I packed my favourite pyjama pants. I have had these pyjama pants for years, and wear them all the time - both to bed, and even during the day when Im at home. I hate the feeling of normal clothes (ie. jeans, tight pants), so whenever I dont have to be at work, or out in public, Im usually in these pyjama pants. 

However, because I wear these pyjama pants so much, they have become a little run down, and theres a few small holes here and there.

Yet whenever my mum has seen me in these pyjama pants, she has always commented on the holes, or states her disbelief as to how I can continue to wear clothes in such a condition. 

When I get back to my own place, I realise that the pyjama pants are no longer in my suitcase. I frantically search for hours, and conclude that I mustve left them at my parents house. I call my mum, to which she nonchalantly tells me that she threw them out. 

Im so angry and upset by this. Ive struggled with clothes my whole life (and body issues, so many clothes make me feel icky), and my pyjama pants were the one item of clothing I could depend on.

It was not his intent, and he had good reason in his mind to sit there (they kept getting out of bed which has in the past lead to fights), but they were uncomfortable nonetheless. I told my boss. She told her boss.

The boss gave a whole lecture on not making false allegations. They, including the men I trusted there, said the girls were making up their feelings because they didnt go to my boss and instead went to me. They were saying things like you know those girls as if they always make it up. The men were all rambling on how it could ruin a life. The director said the man who made them uncomfortable was sensitive so we especially shouldnt say it about him. As I was leaving, Im fairly he went in to talk to the girls about not making false allegations.

The girls were uncomfortable is all I said. That is not an allegation, that is a fact. I assumed it was a misunderstanding and hoped they would change policy to avoid it in the future. But instead I, and the teenage girls there, many of whom have likely been assaulted, were just reminded to not speak up.

Im going to speak to the social worker at the facility about this, but I dont think much will change. Im terrified shell agree with them. Im heartbroken and frankly scared, because I had felt mildly uncomfortable by this man (he seemingly checked me out and then my BOSS did the ooooh as an encouragement) and now I fear I wont be believed should anything happen, even if someone else makes me uncomfortable.

ive been high masking for most of my life, but my symptoms were definitely very clear in my early childhood. but I adapted as much as I could and now as an adult, the issue is learning to unmask is incredibly difficult. I'm making progress, though. 

When I graduated I went through the job cycle that a lot of other autistic people go through. It starts out really good, and then the burnout hits, and you keep pushing until you can't anymore. The longest lasted over two years, but that time has significantly decreased with each job I've had after, with the burnout period getting longer and more devastating every time. And it didn't even matter that I really really loved my old job - the burnout hit anyway at the end of last year, and this is the worst it has ever been.

 I left work in December, and haven't been working since. It's lasted so long that I'm terrified it'll just be forever. And the burnout is so much worse than I've ever had it too - it felt like all of my social skills just deteriorated, I could hardly make eye contact with anyone, even family. My memory is worse than it was before, and oddly enough, I'm clumsier than I used to be? Just no coordination anymore. I love writing, and I used to be very proud of the fact that I could speak well when it was a subject I was very interested in. But now speaking is so incredibly difficult, and there have been times where it physically felt like I couldn't. When I'm trying, it's a lot of fumbling, struggling, apologizing. It's been months. I don't think these skills are coming back.

I miss the person I used to be. I miss all the things that I was able to do. I feel so useless now, like a shell of a person sometimes. And I feel so infantalized as well? Like I'm a grown woman with a child's brain. I have a lot of behaviors and interests that are very childlike, stuffed animals, dolls, wearing only pastel colors, my hyperfixations, and I've only just recently begun to LET myself stim, which often makes me feel infantalized, but I'm working to try to get past that bc obviously it helps me regulate so much in a way I never realized was possible. The most I would do before is twirl my hair, only things that I thought other people could deem normal. I know a lot of this is like...internalized ableism, but I'm working really hard to change my outlook on my behaviors that are just who I am.

It isn't all bad, though. I have made new friends online, bc as you can imagine, leaving the house is incredibly difficult now, and often times after a social outing I will spend DAYS recovering. My best friend is an autistic girl my age, and it's like we're twin souls, at the exact same stage in our lives and struggling through exactly the same things. It's such a relief to relay things to her and have someone know exactly what I'm talking about. 

And also, despite all of the social skill regression, I went out on a date. I explained in great detail what had been happening in my life, because I just so desperately wanted to make sure he knew exactly what he was getting into - I have no job, and I am very much learning who I am, and trying to recover from this burnout. But he was all in. The date went about how you would expect - I struggled a lot. I was so incredibly nervous, constantly fidgeting with a stim toy, hardly ever making eye contact. I struggled to talk, except when I found a reason to rant about a hyperfixation. Then I just wouldn't stop talking. 

When I would realize I was probably talking too long, I would get really embarrassed and apologize, but he told me he loved it, he liked listening to me - even if it was about a hyperfixation he knew nothing about. I've never had that before, and now, almost two months later, I'm still apologizing for talking too much (working on it), and he's still telling me how much he loves it. He knows I need constant reassurance and clarification and he is more than willing to give that to me. 

I felt like I was unlovable when this burnout hit. But I guess I'm not. He reminds me all the time. He knows what I'm capable of, and has told me that even if my ability to work and my skills don't return, he will be more than willing to take care of me - he wants to. This was a really big issue for me at the beginning, because it really feels awful to admit that you can't provide for yourself and would need to rely on someone else. But I'm coming to terms with it.

I'm trying to come to terms with the fact that I am just...actually disabled now? It still feels weird to claim, it feels like a lie because I wasn't disabled last year. Masking long term just damaged me so much cognitively and I'm so resentful because this could have been avoided if only I had known, you know? 

But I am grateful to know now. So grateful. I definitely wouldn't know the people I've grown to care about so much if things went any differently.","AutismInWomen",126,"https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismInWomen/comments/15gqi9k/i_didnt_realize_i_was_autistic_until_24_and_now/"

I wanted to take a moment to share my thoughts and experiences regarding the challenges that many autistic women face when it comes to dating and relationships. As a 28-year-old woman who was undiagnosed with ASD for a long time, I understand firsthand the struggles and feelings of inadequacy that can arise from not knowing why things weren't working out.

For the longest time, I felt like there was something inherently wrong with me because I couldn't navigate relationships in the same way as others. The fear of rejection paralyzed me, preventing me from dating or meeting new people. And when, by sheer effort, I did engage in conversations, I found myself at a loss for what to do or how to proceed. It was a constant source of confusion and frustration.

Only through therapy, changing my perspective, and continuous self-improvement did I begin to break free from these barriers. I eventually mustered the courage to try online dating and was fortunate enough to meet my current partner. However, it's important to acknowledge that it wasn't an easy journey, and it requires ongoing new insights and personal growth.

I already noticed that [r/aspergers](https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/) seems to allow dozens of posts each day about the men there struggling to date, usually with a hint of possessiveness, a lot of self-pity, and an overall sense of blaming women for their struggles. Yesterday, there was a rare post where not a man, but a woman, shared their struggles with dating. Instead of fostering empathy and understanding, the comments turned into a competition of who has it worse, with some men claiming that women have it easier when it comes to relationships, because of reasons that are literally both too Victorian and dumb to repeat. This narrative is not only misguided but also dismissive of the challenges we, as autistic women, face.

I firmly believe that these attitudes stem from a toxic blend of entitlement and the perpetuation of incel-like ideologies. It's disheartening to witness so many autistic men falling into this trap and minimizing the struggles that women go through too. Such a mindset creates a toxic environment that fosters misogyny and fails to address the real issues at hand.

It seems that some autistic men may be more susceptible to embracing incel logic due to the challenges they face in dating, as it can be easier to blame women instead of self-reflecting, and the structured and simplistic narrative offered by incel ideology may provide a sense of predictability and understanding compared to the often complex and unpredictable nature of dating. So instead of supporting each other, fostering understanding, and recognizing that everyone's experiences are valid, women's struggles are diminished.

It disturbs me to witness such viewpoints, which ultimately led me to unsubscribe from the toxicity that exists in [r/aspergers](https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/). It's disheartening that instead of striving for a more inclusive community, some individuals feel the need to minimize and even exclude women, as if having autism isn't hard enough on its own.

At this point I realised that he's actually trying to give me, a paying customer, a shit for my face expression (I get this comment a lot because I have big round eyes and people say I look like I really want to ask a question but too shy to speak first lol and my lips are downwards looking when my face is neutral) and for not smiling for him. 

So I just said ""Can I pay for the treatment?"" and I guess it reminded him that he's actually at work and I'm a customer, so he proceeded to passive-aggressively slam a card reader on the counter and said nothing after that, ignored my ""Goodbye"" too.

I emailed a complaint, but got no response so they either don't care or it's also a receptionist's job to read them and this man just deleted my message.

I need 3 more treatments but now I don't want to go back there. Maybe it's just my confirmation bias, but I only hear this rude shit from men, women never ask why I look at them *like this* or demand I smile.

I went to an event recently which was in part held by an autistic organization and so many of the people there were autistic (and presumably other types of ND). I've been attempting over the past couple years since my diagnosis to build an autistic community in person to very little success for a number of reasons. I went to this event because a friend invited me and I do enjoy this friend's company. I left feeling very defeated as I once again felt thoroughly uncomfortable and wanting to leave.

Reasons why this event and hanging out with other groups of autistic have been unsuccessful include:

Being monologued at. I appreciate that other people have special interests and like to info dump. However, being monologued at especially about something I find thoroughly uninteresting by someone I barely know is very frustrating and I can feel myself losing attention immediately (I have AuDHD). Ironically, I have to mask to avoid making the other person feel bad.

Similarly, autistic people in general interrupt me a lot more than NT, which completely makes me forget what I'm saying and makes me confused . Both ND and NT people do interrupt me, but usually I tell an NT person once sternly and they'll be mindful, but most of the autistic people I know  in person will not respect this.

More broadly, I've noticed that a lot of the autistic people I know have a lot of difficulty respecting my personal boundaries. This has happened several times. I once was helping a fellow autistic with paperwork, I had offered this help to her. She took this offer and began to text me multiple long paragraphs per day, 30 minutes of audio messages (which I hate). I tried to establish communication rules with her, clear ones, and she would respect them for a few days and then go back to breaking them. I eventually told her I was going to block her--and did block her--because of repeatedly breaking my limits. 

On a coffee date with an autistic friend, she told me how her boss had asked her to stop texting him for things unrelated to work, and then went on how she understands that he asked her not to but she NEEDS to tell him about her random thoughts in long text messages at 3am and so she isn't going to stop. 

Another autistic friend, when asked by someone to please change the subject with regards to something triggering, refused to do so, and ultimately caused the person requesting to have a panic attack and cut off all contact with my friend.


Conflicting sensory needs. For example, I know this one person who is a good person and I appreciate them but does very loud vocal stimming and my noise sensitivity cannot tolerate it so I actively avoid them. Also I spend so much time trying to manage my own sensory needs, it is impossible for me to keep track of the sensory needs of multiple people in my environment.


Basically I feel like I can't be in community anywhere. NT spaces have a whole bunch of issues that are discussed in this forum at length. I definitely feel more UNDERSTOOD in ND Groups, --for example at this party I wore my headphones inside the whole time and nobody was weird about it-- but in my case ND people are not easier for me to be around, which is a little heartbreaking. 


Anybody else have had a similar experience? I feel like I can't exist with groups of people anywhere.

Fixed work desk - teams must sit together and we have a hot-desking policy. We are not going to make the entire &lt;team name&gt; move for one person so they can have a fixed desk space.

Not being given more than 1 additional task beyond phones in a day - this is a standard requirement of the job if she cannot do it then she cannot do the job and we will release her on capability grounds

Medical appointments - we are a small team and her absence negatively impacts on the rest of the team and shows she is incapable of doing her job

Reduced performance targets - she is a high level senior employee in the department - there is minimum standards she is expected to hit. If she doesnt hit these then she will be let go on performance grounds.

Being more tolerant of lateness etc: we have set work hours this is a conduct issue.


Ultimately every adjustment they want is essentially proving that I am largely incapable of functioning as a fully fledged adult and is why I am treated like a child by many around me - it is because mentally I am still a child even if Im high functioning.

Some guy in the comments said that autistic women struggle to recognise their own feelings, so they might say no and still be sexually interested deep down.  
I was fine with the first part as I have alexithymia myself, but I found the second part problematic because so many people use that to be pushy with autistic people with the excuse that ""you don't know what you want, let me show you"".  
I commented that an autistic woman's no isn't negotiable and that ""no"" means ""no"" regardless of neurotype. Beliefs like his own are part of the reason why 9/10 autistic women are&gt;!molested, harrassed, and sexually abused!&lt;.  
He came back with a weak ""I never said that. Malice comes from people who don't want to understand.""

I know I shouldn't be mad and I usually have a more limited emotional range, but I'm very irked right now. This wasn't an interaction I had on this account, so it's not in my history and I'm not sure whether I should link the thread (it's not even in English).  
I told him that having a different neurotype and not wanting to understand are very different things, and that I take what he says literally but words have consequences. The consequence of believing autistic women may reject you when they're actually interested is what leads people to not take an autistic woman's rejection seriously and take it instead as a challenge and continue harrassing her and feeling entitled to her.  
He's not responded and I doubt he's going to. He doesn't have to, honestly - I'm just mad some NT guy get to play the fake coy ""teehee I never said that"", play dumb and act innocent while framing me as the one at fault.  
I *wish* mine was malice. Autistic women being molested at alarming rates isn't a hypothetical scenario: it already happens all the time and statistics prove that. I'm factually correct. Why does that not matter?

edit: trying to shame me for admitting to not remaining completely emotionless is an unrealistic expectation that I refuse to internalise. You *should* take no shit when someone's trying to walk all over you. Some of you are mighty comfortable with women being sad, but not with them expressing anything akin to anger because anger gives people agency.

I think my autism irritated the office manager because she would be very passive aggressive about things I was doing.  For instance spending too much time with the low income patients when I should be focusing on the paying customers.   Or just sitting with the older patients a bit longer than others because they wanted to talk. (3 or 4 min?) 

It kept getting worse and suddenly she was sending me to 2 other locations now and again ""On doctors orders"" and when I come back there would be a trashed office, with work laying all over the place. 

The decision to look elsewhere was when a family member died over a weekend, I texted her that I would be out of state Thursday and Friday.  Not only did she not text back, she told me the following Monday to not text on the weekend.  When I came back she complained I missed too much work. 

Ever since I put in my two weeks the office manager was really awful.  She would make remarks to other coworkers (who stuck up for me thankfully) would ask if I could handle things or should she ask others, etc.

2 days ago I ended up having a long chat with someone, and not even about the weather! Shes very nice, VERY chatty, asks lots of questions, we had lots in common - apart from the fact she loves talking to strangers. But instead of naturally splitting off down separate paths (of which there are many), she walked with me the entire way round. Until we got to our cars, where I said goodbye and she said Ill probably bump into you tomorrow and I died inside. 

So, yesterday, there she was. She did a total u-turn on her route and joined me on my walk. Instead of feeling energised and calm when I got back to my car, I felt drained. Even my dog was a bit miffed because shes used to me just playing with her and encouraging her along. 

So today, I am not doing a morning walk. Im changing my time in the hopes I can have a quiet, just me and my dog stroll again. 

But all morning Ive just been feeling so guilty, imagining this lovely, friendly woman walking around looking for someone to talk too. So whilst I wont feel drained later, I will feel like an awful person. 

I keep thinking, what if shes trying to meet new people and Im the one she first approaches and now Im not turning up ever again and shell think maybe its her and wont try and make new friends and is actually really lonely and IVE RUINED IT

I wish I could tell her hey, its not you. It really is me. There are loads of chatty people around here who will walk with you 3x a day if you want. You just got unlucky approaching me. Youll find a walking buddy no problem, please dont give up 

Now my stupid visual brain is visualising her slowly walking back to her car, sad and friendless, with her dog behind her, tail not wagging. And shes driving home wondering whats wrong with her, and basically thinking all the things that usually are going through my mind. Her dog wont even eat its food that night, he just nudges the bowl towards his sobbing owner. My stupid visual brain can see it now.

So Ive been collecting cool plates for a while now and like my other safe utensils (cups, cutlery etc) Im very fond of them and they make daily activities a little more joyful. 

Well, last week my dad put my favorite cup on the washing machine and it got destroyed by the heat. It was a small Hello Kitty cup I bought in London, the last and probably only time I can remember being genuinely happy. I cried so much and my dad just yelled at me saying he didnt ruin it. It was so so very special to me and now the design is all melted off. Today I heard a bang and when my dad told me it was my plate I simply put my hands on my mouth in shock and he started yelling at the top of his lungs with me. Saying it was just a stupid plate and that I was dramatic and a child for being upset. Im obviously softening because he went beserk on me and told me to stop crying and that if I even thought about keeping the rest of my plates somewhere safe that he would throw me out. Fuck it, I did just that and now theyre locked in my closet, along with the rest of my cups. Now no one can touch them but I cant use them either. 

Ive been crying all day and hes just being overly disgusted with me for being upset. You know, if he had at least said he was sorry to me like oh sorry i know you really liked that plate it was an accident i wouldnt be this upset its just that everyone dismisses me, and it feels like im a freak for mourning a plate that made my meals a bit brighter. So im just venting since I thought someone here would understand& thank you for reading.

""You don't present as ADHD."" Made me feel like I was crazy for thinking I could be neurodivergent at all, and that my executive function *was* ""just laziness."" Caused me to postpone seeking an evaluation for years... only for my evaluating psychiatrist to immediately be like, ""Yup, you're ADHD as fuck, woman. Your struggles in life make perfect sense.""


I really need a therapist right now. I had a hard time finding one who takes my insurance, so all hopes of neurodivergence-affirmation went out the window. But I still didn't expect to have my self-diagnosis be dismissed within the first *five minutes*. When I told her that I suspect I'm autistic, she immediately said, ""Women aren't usually candidates for autism diagnoses."" Note: I have an evaluation in January with a place that *exclusively* evaluates WOMEN. Lmao. 


Why do therapists--not even psychiatrists or psychologists--insist on throwing out uneducated opinions on things they don't specialize in? This therapist does *not* specialize anywhere close to autism or neurodivergence. She specializes in relationships! But after FIVE MINUTES of meeting me, she was somehow able to confidently tell me that I don't have autism?


And this was *after* me telling her that I haven't had a friend in a decade, that I haven't worked in years because of severe burnout/social issues/sensory issues, how I'm currently clinging to my routine for dear life, and her generally seeing how badly I was struggling to speak to her. ""Yeah, but you had a friend in high school, right?"" Oh my god.


You know it's bad when you start the conversation NOT masking, and end it masking heavily because you feel so misunderstood by the end. ""Oh come on, you *really* don't have a single friend?"" Just really sucks, because I'm struggling a lot and literally cannot find another therapist. But I think talking to her might even make things worse.


I am so. so. so. SO. tired of the myth that if you weren't diagnosed in childhood, that means you aren't autistic. A mental health professional should know that this shit gets *missed*. They should know that women and girls slip through the cracks all the time. UGH. People like her just don't realize that evaluations are incredibly expensive, and they are a privilege that not every autistic person is awarded.

I get so anxious, its hard to sit for so long, the end result never seems to match what we discuss in the consultation and Im petrified of having a meltdown. 

Ive been going to my salon  for 3 years. One senior stylist I love - shes dyslexic and small talk is easy, and shes great at her job. But shes so in demand that I have been trying to find a new stylist at the same salon recently. Its been an utter disaster. 

The first girl was so anxious in my presence that after 2 hours of sitting in the chair, she was still cutting and I was starving. She couldnt finish the cut and the senior stylist came over and finished it off so I could go home. 

The last girl, makes absolutely no small talk (which ironically makes me more anxious because Im sitting there thinking she hates me). The colour we discussed was a blondy brown and what I got was a dark brown. My mask dropped at the end and I said this is darker than what we discussed and she got really aggressive and short with me. Perhaps I had a small meltdown? Not sure, mostly I have shutdowns I thought, and I dont have the self harm meltdowns so I dont know if I know what my meltdowns look like. 

She said Im not going to argue with you in a really short voice like she was just done being in my presence. 

I ruminated about that for weeks, and called the salon to apologise to her if it was awkward and to explain that I get really anxious and had brainstormed some questions that would have helped during the consultation at the start. She'd also quoted me for a take-home toner that she didn't give me, and given I paid $560 I wanted to check if I'd actually paid for it, so I could pick it up.

[Edit: more detail for clarity]

 left a message with the manager who said the stylist would have to call me back because they didn't have access to the quote to check on the toner, but I didn't hear for a week so I figured she had gotten busy, so the next week I called and left another message with the manager who apologised profusely for her not returning me back, and again said she'd get her to call me back, another week went by so I thought she'd just gotten busy.

The third and last time I called (the only time I spoke to her) she was short with me, obviously didnt want to talk to me, and after explaining that Im autistic and that communication is difficult for me and I get really anxious she said thanks for apologising. No acknowledgment that Im now at the point where in need to take Valium to go the salon or what Im going through at all, just focused on her own experience (fine, I guess? It is her job?).  It felt like she hadnt forgotten but had actually been avoiding calling me back, when the salon manager was telling me she would. 

Today I got my hair cut with my regular stylist and the salon manager spoke to me afterwards to talk about what happened last time and apparently she was upset for days after doing my hair. He said do you think weve tried to accommodate you? and asked 7 times are you happy coming here?. I started crying and said it feels like youre asking me to find a new salon -  is that whats happening? Eventually he said I have to protect my stylists.

I am embarrassed and upset. I cant pretend to be a normal person for long enough to even get my hair cut, and some people literally hate being in my presence - they seem to either get anxiety from me, or get really angry and take everything I say in a way that I dont mean. (I once called the front desk to say it would be good to have some curly/wavy hair on their social media so I could figure out which cutter to see, and they wrote down in my client notes that I *complained* that they werent diverse enough - the manager brought this complaint up in the chat too - that I had formally complained about their social media and that they werent inclusive. 

I know there are autistic people out there who come across as rude/abrasive and I guess I know for sure now that Im one of them. I try *so hard* to be a nice person and I guess Im just a failure. I absolutely hate myself right now and have been crying for two hours about it. 
 
Thanks for reading my diatribe. Not sure if Im looking for advice - but this was the first salon that Id been open with about being autistic. Not sure what to do next time. Or how to stop feeling so shitty and sorry for myself :/

[Edit: I went to their Instagram to unfollow them and noticed that their profile is super inclusive - lots of people of colour, lots of hair types. I scrolled back to when I would have told them it would be good to have more hair types/styles on their insta, and it was all white women with tonged blonde hair! So they took my feedback as actual feedback, and then spun it to me that I made a complaint to them and was unhappy with their service?? Okiedokie then! Feeling somewhat less shit rn.]

[Final edit: after replying to a comment and thinking about it, I suspect she's also autistic. She doesn't talk at all during a 4-hour service (apparently she does this with all clients), doesn't look you in the eye, got really anxious around me, avoided my phone call.... how did I not pick it up!!!

Examples:

If an long forgotten acquaintance you bump into randomly says that you should meet up sometimes but is vague, that means never. You shouldn't add them on Facebook or email to follow up. 

If a former good friend suddenly only wants to meet within a group setting, that relationship is over. 

If someone, especially a potential date, ASKS for you to confirm the meeting the day of, don't count on it and make other plans.

ONE electronic non reply (Social Media, Text, IM) where you know it delivered is a rejection. Don't keep following up to make sure. 

If a former colleague or acquaintance reaches out of a blue sky, they want something either implicit (ego boost, laughs) or explicit (job referral, expertise, hookup, gossip). 

People make relationships largely out of what they get out of it in some form, not how good natured/earnest a person is.

Once a friendship goes sour, you are better off severing that cord than dragging it out.

Edit: 

If that friend only meets up when all the stars align for them (winter, coffee shop around the corner, Wednesday night) they just aren't that into you.

If someone cancels or reject a meetup offer and doesn't counterproposal for a better time, it's OVA!

""Nice guys"" will often use a hook to make their physical advances like a new anime series, videogames, pet, marijuana, comic book movie.

If you aren't sure about sending that social media/LinkedIn connection request to a person, trust your gut and pass.

If that friend always cancels with you due to a sick child, flu, car troubles but you see on social media that they are still going out , Hasta La Vista Baby!

Summary: I think a lot of you would benefit from reading Doc Love. He was a 90s dating coach that based his methodology on sales. His premise is that interest level dictates everything, a buyer/friend/date that has high interest will move heaven and earth to connect with you. Those with lukewarm or low interest level give mixed signals, passive aggression, excuses and it's better to move on early than torture yourself.","AutismInWomen",714,"https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismInWomen/comments/10pb2f5/what_social_behaviour_are_you_ashamed_to_admit/"

 I went back to my car and ate my lunch. I called my mom, in tears, and told her what happened. She told me that I needed to go back in and stand up for myself. 

I reluctantly went back in and apologized for the door situation. Then I tried to explain how I felt after she yelled at me. She looked at me point blank and said I dont care.

I will overexplain a problem/situation and just keep going around and around in circles because once I'm done explaining, normally the situation doesn't change. I am attempting to hammer home the significance of what I am saying and it's impact on me, hoping this will finally be the time it's taken seriously. The reality is, it generally isn't taken seriously because of the empathy gap where the other person just cannot relate to my experience and how something they do so easily is something I claim I can't handle.
I want to work on not explaining myself so much, and realising when enough is enough. My power doesn't come from explaining myself, it comes from setting boundaries with others and taking action to meet my needs. When I rely on others' empathy to help me change a situation, it rarely ever changes. It doesn't matter whether they understand as much as it matters that I find a way to solve my own problems regardless of whether anyone understands them.","AutismInWomen",54,"https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismInWomen/comments/1clfkie/we_over_explain_because_our_needs_are_still_unmet/"

He moved me into the spare bedroom a couple months ago because he said he didn't sleep well with me even though we slept together for almost 3 years prior. He is no longer kind or thoughtful, he's mean and judgemental instead and blames his physical pain. He's been punishing me a lot the last few months as well by taking away the car (i have my own now) or completely shutting me out. Tonight I tried to ask him how long I'll be punished for this time and he exploded. He told me he doesn't like me anymore and everything I do is dumb and that he doesn't care what I do anymore and I can live with him and his brother (he can't afford his house without me) but I have to leave him alone because he's in too much pain to deal with me anymore. 

None of that was a surprise to me. I even thought its what I wanted but I didn't expect to be alone. My husband is my best and only friend. I honestly thought he was my person. I'm not close with my family and they live literally across the country. I feel like I have no one and I don't want to die alone. I just wanted a best friend that I could share life with, why is it so hard to find? I've been searching my whole life for this person, I'm 33 now. I can't do this by myself

What do I do? I tried finding like minded friends and I ended up with fair weather girls that only want to see/hear the good parts and offer none of the support I needed. 

I want to beg my husband to not abandon me, beg to be friends again. But I know he's vindictive and will feel like he wins when he sees me cry. 

I'm sorry if this isn't the right place to complain but I didn't know where else to turn. Any thoughts or advice is appreciated.

I could no longer work and gradually faded away from society to live as a recluse. Two years ago, I stopped using social media and ghosted everyone I knew including members of my own family. Some of them may not even know that I'm still alive. They used to send messages asking if I was ok, and I never responded. 

But it wasn't because I didn't care; it was because I no longer felt capable of interacting with people at all in any capacity whatsoever. I don't even leave the house because friendly neighbors always want to chat when they see me. I get everything delivered, including groceries, and wait until they have driven away before opening the door to collect them. And I only do that when my husband isn't around to do it for me. 

When I first joined this group about a month ago, I thought I had found a sanctuary. A place I could come to where, for the first time, I was surrounded by people I understood and who understood me. The ""honeymoon"" lasted about two weeks, until the issues I was having with social interactions in real life began affecting me here as well. I am just too emotionally damaged to handle even the slightest of misunderstandings or disagreements. 

Maybe it's PTSD from a lifetime of not being heard, accepted, or understood. I don't know. My mind and intellectual capacity is still intact, but the rest of me feels like I'm reduced to a primitive, childhood state. I can barely take care of myself. Having to make basic decisions like what to have for dinner is stressful and challenging. I often wish I had parents to take care of me. My house is a mess because I feel incapable of cleaning the way I used to, but I need a clean environment to improve my state of well-being. I feel like I'm in prison serving out a life sentence. 

I enjoy writing. It helps me process my emotions in a way I'm unable to verbally. I've been considering writing a book about what it was like for me to go through life undiagnosed, but I question why anyone would care. I am no one. I am not interesting. Sometimes when I write posts in this sub, it gets downvoted or very little response. My ""intellectual"" side says ""So what? It doesn't mean anything"", but my ""primitive"" side says ""No one relates to you"", or ""You don't belong here"", or ""Your writing isn't very good. People find it uninteresting, unhelpful, and boring. Writing a book would be a waste of time"". 

But some of my posts get a lot of responses. And I get overwhelmed by the attention. If I get more than 20 comments, I stop reading them and never return to my post again. It doesn't upset me, but it does make me feel uncomfortable and under pressure to respond so ""ghosting"" (for lack of a better term) is my default response and I don't feel in control of it. It doesn't feel like a choice, even though it must be.

In under a month, I have had a few meltdowns just from interacting with people on reddit. Sometimes in this subreddit, and sometimes from others. It is the subreddits that I feel most connected to that affect me the most. Here, it's personal. Other subreddits are mostly centered on my personal interests. Either way, they are places I feel ""safe"" among like minded individuals. So when there's misunderstanding or disagreement, I take it 100x harder than anywhere else. 

I wish I wasn't like this. It's embarrassing. Logically, I know I'm being completely irrational and hypersensitive for no reason. But logic cannot save me from the primitive emotions that take control of my brain. My capacity for logic and reason feels like it is dying, and I am just a shell of the person I once was. It seems that all people, even the good ones, even those who understand and love me, are toxic to my psychological well-being. Because when I cease interactions altogether, my mood VASTLY improves. I feel ""normal"" again. I don't feel depressed or anxious. 

I wish I wasn't this way. I wish a lot of things. I wish I had known about autism sooner. I wish I had known about burnout and had seen the red flags. I wish I was productive. I wish I didn't hate myself so much. I wish I could be more concise and not ramble so much. I wish I didn't feel like a burden on my husband. I wish I wasn't so hypersensitive. And I wish I could interact in this sub and help others. But I just don't feel good enough, or strong enough, to be around other people.","AutismInWomen",122,"https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismInWomen/comments/142fcfx/im_unable_to_interact_with_people_including_on/"

They even have a quiet option when booking appointments so I leaped at the opportunity to get my hair cut there. No awkward chatter, just business. So I felt comfortable to disclose I have autism- Im newly diagnosed and I just wanted to be proud and open about it in a seemingly comfortable environment&

When I arrived for my appointment (right on time), there were about 4 stylists and no one greeted me. I eventually caught the attention of one who was on her phone and then was made to wait 5 minutes (now were 10 minutes late for my appointment). Prior to my appointment, I had disclosed my autism so they were aware. I ended up getting a trainee stylist who botched my hair and kept asking another colleague how to cut my hair as she had no clue how to angle her scissors when making layers. There was also another girl shadowing the trainee so I essentially had 4 stylists hovered all over me, scrutinising the trainees cluelessness and my hair. During all this, another stylist commented on how I barely have any hair to work with to another client, then laughed, which sucked because Ive always struggled to style my fine hair. 

While there was barely any small talk, which is what I requested, I just felt like a complete outsider. It seemed like they were so tense around me, not knowing what to say or how to behave. Which is no coincidence, because Ive been in there before to get my hair done and people treated me like an actual human being before I disclosed my tism.

Everyone else said how nice they are and that they'd love to spend time with them. 

Then they started saying misogynist/racist/biphobic things. 

Another example. My sister's boyfriend is 16 years older than her and started dating her when she was 19. The rest of my family loved him and talked about how nice he was, how he bought them nice things etc. (Love bombing) and everyone told me to stop being judgemental and give him a chance. 

He just got them evicted by not paying the bills, he's a gambler, he's having trouble with custody/his children that he didn't tell her about until now. (She just gave birth to his kid so I guess he figures he has her locked down now.)

I guess I just want to vent and maybe see if anyone thinks I was in the wrong here. This may be obvious but I am autistic. 

I work as an employee/supervisor at an escape room. We charge $35 per person, the exception being that children under 6 years old can go in for free. I was working by myself this morning and it was quite busy, so I was already getting overwhelmed with how much was going on. I was running in between the rooms and the back office where I have to watch the players from. 

A family comes in, a middle aged husband and wife and their three sons of varying age. I ask if they have a booking with us, they said no, we'd like to do a walk-in. I let them know which room is currently available. 

The mother then says ""Our son can't play but we can't leave him here, do we still need to buy a ticket?"" 

I said ""Yes sorry, you must buy a ticket for children over six years old.""

She gets quiet and says ""Well... He's not mentally over six.""

I hadn't looked at their son at this point but I saw him sitting on the couch. He looked to be around 10-13. I unfortunately could tell that she was implying he was autistic (by basically implying that he's no smarter than a six year old..... Ew). 

I said ""I'm sorry, I don't think I can do that."" It's the rules. And besides I felt icky about them basically telling me that since he's ""not smart enough"" to play that he should get in for free. They weren't even going to help him participate, they made it sound like they had a pet with them that they couldn't just leave behind. 

They were put out by that but the mom decided to sit out with him so the dad and other sons could play. I took their payment and showed them how to sign the waivers. I then had to leave the front desk to go into the back office and check on my groups in the cameras. 

A few moments later, the office door opens. This already made me very uncomfortable because it's clearly not a public area, it's back behind the front desk. The father is there and he says ""Excuse me, we changed our mind. We'd like a refund""

This happens every once in a while, no big deal, I can issue the refund and they can be on their way. So I tell him that's no problem and go back to the desk to give the refund. 

While there he asks if I'm the manager. I tell him no, but I am a supervisor. He asks if there's a manager around, I said no it's just me. He then says ""Well it's just ridiculous that you require a 13 year olds email for the waiver.""

I was about to tell him he can simply put his own email in that place, but before I could he said ""It's also ridiculous that you want to charge me $35 for my autistic son to play.""

I didn't really know what to say to this. I thought about mentioning that I myself am autistic, but I figured he wouldn't believe me. So I said ""I'm sorry, we have to charge for anyone over 6.""

He continued to argue with me and started getting aggressive. I don't really remember much of the conversation at that point because I was getting really flustered and scared. I was getting angry as well, because I felt bad for the child and I felt I was in the right to adhere to the rules. Admittedly I did not handle it very well. I tried not to respond while I gave the refund, and he said something like ""we don't want to be here if this is how we'll be treated.""

I said ""Great. Then leave."" 

He started yelling about how ""I don't need some 24 year old twit to tell me anything"" and insulting me in other ways. So I went back into the office because I didn't feel safe. 

He FOLLOWED ME BACK INTO THE OFFICE and continued to demand his refund, which had already gone through. I felt so threatened and I was angry and done with him. I did raise my voice and tell him ""Your refund has gone through. Get out."" and I slammed the office door in his face. 

I immediately started sobbing/having a meltdown. And I still had so much to do. Thankfully they finally left. 

I don't know, should I have given them the free ticket?? It just didn't seem right to me in the moment. I'm feeling like, violated I guess is the right word. I've never been yelled at and insulted like that. But I can't stop replaying the scenario in my head and wondering if I really f*cked it up.

Myself, my dad, my husband, my aunt, my cousin, and my father in law. And not just autism, neurodivergence too. Maybe ADHD in my mom and dyslexia in my brother.

In fact I think back to some deceased relatives and Im certain they were struggling with neurodivergence too. One was shunned from the family for their erratic behavior, another very quiet and obsessed with trains until the day he died, another self medicated with alcohol and had epic meltdowns as an adult that I vividly remember from my childhood.

Last night while doing more research I was looking at the Autism Center of the big regional university, who unfortunately do not do adult diagnoses at this time. But they have a couple of links for adults seeking diagnosis, and I found the below section very interesting, particularly their note about the accuracy of self-diagnosis. 

From (edit - the self-diagnosed resources link) [here](https://depts.washington.edu/uwautism/resources/adult-resources/):

&gt;	In our experience at the University of Washington Autism Center, many professionals are not informed about the variety of ways that autism can appear, and often doubt an autistic persons accurate self-diagnosis. In contrast, inaccurate self-diagnosis of autism appears to be uncommon. We believe that if you have carefully researched the topic and strongly resonate with the experience of the autistic community, you are probably autistic.

I find the call-out of accurate self-diagnosis interesting, especially compared to some of my other health issues where it is almost entirely dismissed that a self-diagnosis is accurate (even when, surprise, clinical testing proves it was.)","AutismInWomen",104,"https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismInWomen/comments/ovt9w0/an_interesting_commentary_on_autism_selfdiagnosis/"

I've noticed our sexuality is not often discussed.

It has been on my mind how being autistic has influenced the way sex played a role in my life. 

Sex was a subconscious way that I masked sometimes.  I felt confident when I was sexual. I knew who to be and how to act. I was still awkward, of course, it just didn't matter much because of how good I was at it. I practically studied how to make people feel good to a science >√™.

&amp;#x200B;

In a way, being a good fling enabled the longevity of some of the connections I made. And I did have many intimate moments with people, but they were all tiny contained moments of being known. Anything longer than a few hours felt scary.



 Sex was a way that I felt wanted when who I was didn't feel like enough. I didn't actively think this, I thought what I was doing was empowering. I even thought that I was seeking true intimacy through sex. How often my hookups wanted to see me felt like I was truly connecting, until I saw what true connection was. And when I met the man who wanted to step up, I got scared and ran.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm thinking about all of this because at one point early last year I met someone that completely shifted how I saw myself sexually. 

&amp;#x200B;

  I didn't allow myself to think it'd be anything more than a hook up for a while because of how wonderful he was. 

 He was sweet, smart, funny, confident, and handsome beyond belief. Imagine your exact type and they're also the most beautiful person you've ever seen. And they also love you? It was nuts. 

 I literally couldn't imagine he'd ever want to date me, and then he asked me to be his girlfriend one night.

  
It hit me all at once how much sex was a social crutch for me. Suddenly this amazing man was telling me I made him happy, and all I could feel was dread that one day it would click for him and he'd see me as too strange. When we were just friends with benefits, I didn't feel so exposed.

 It was a genuine shock to be seen fully, like that scene from Fleabag where the hot priest asks her where she goes in her mind (or something?). She yelps in surprise that he saw her ""mask"" drop momentarily.

 My non-verbal episodes would hit me hard when I became overwhelmed by staying at his place for days at a time. When he started seeing me romantically, he shifted less from being highly sexual with me, and more into emotional intimacy.  Me being non-verbal and non-expressive (when I was overwhelmed)was confusing to him, and I wasn't effectively communicating through those moments. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sex was an emotional shield, and once I was no longer just a hookup, I had to let someone know me and risk them not liking me. I ended up not taking the risk. I saw how much personal growth I still needed before I could in good conscience be alongside someone as their partner.

&amp;#x200B;

I ended the relationship more than a month ago. It was amicable, and we remain friends.It's been hard to walk away from him, but I think it was for the best. 


Since our break up, I don't want to hook up with other people like I used to. There's been so many chances, it's like old hookups can sense when you're newly single. But I'm at home every night doing my silly little mindfulness exercises and I've bought sex toys.

 TLDR;
I thought sex was a way I connected, but I think sex was also a way I built emotional distance from people. And it got me thinking of how many times I shielded myself from someone trying to get to know me through only seeking casual sex.

I don't have friends. The two people I'm mostly close to I invited to come with me, but one forgot and the other just came and said hi and chatted for a few minutes and left.

Each therapist would help to an extent but I was working so hard trying to get better and always feel like there was something wrong with me. That the meds and talking about my childhood and things that made me anxious where not getting me anywhere.

Now that I know I'm autisitic and puzzle pieces are fitting together. I realised how toxic and damaging the illness mentality has been for me. Autism is part of me and seeing parts of my personality/ things I struggle with as an illness was like hating yourself or othering part of yourself. No wonder I couldn't get better and I feel like in some ways therapy for anxiety and depression can be incredibly damaging to autistic people. It also focus so much on my family dynamics and it alienated my parents. 

Now that I know I'm autisitic it's ok to be weird and antisocial. It's ok to struggle in certain situations. I'm free of trying so hard to manage my anxiety all the time and instead know which situations are problematic for me. Breathing techniques and self talk won't change my brain struggling with it.

My closet is technically a walk-in, but it's really narrow, so I've got basically a twin mattress sized space on the floor.

It ended with me in tears","Edit: I spoke with HR. I'm taking the day off. I'm probably gonna stop responding to this thread. I just really need to get this off my mind. Thank you a for your support. 

So it was the end of the day and I was just about to leave when my manager asked if I could do a zoom call.

So I say yes and a minute later his manager calls me into a group call. Now I've been fired and harassed by management before, so unexpected meetings terrify me. Especially if there's someone there I wasn't expecting.

So I get into the call and they very stern and serious. They do the usual formalities and whatnot. Then the head of my department says ""So IT tells us you've been doing something to your computer to make it crash.""

For context earlier that day my computer crashed and I had to add a few hours to a project.

I start panicking and try to explain myself, at this point I'm holding back tears. Then suddenly he says ""I'm just kidding. We actually called you in for this other reason.""

So at that point just trying to hold it together. And he keeps doubling down. He makes jokes about my manager hating me, then goes ""Just kidding. Or am I?""

Then the call ends and I just started sobbing at my desk.

I don't want to go back to work tomorrow. I feel horrible. I've been on edge for the last several hours.

I really struggle with sarcasm, and I never understood pranks. Honestly they just feel mean. Does anyone even enjoy being pranked?

I debated whether I should have my parents fill it out, and eventually came to the conclusion of why not. 

So I spoke to my mum about it on the phone, and said how it has various questions about me as a child and now. I said how they should just say how things looked to them (some of the questions ask what I liked etc, which they obviously wont know for certain, but they can comment on what they thought I liked). Some questions would be about how I was at school, which will be more to do with what teachers said about me, since they werent actually there to see.

She said some things about how I was like as a child and how there wasnt really anything weird. Teachers loved me, I was good at maths and well behaved. At home I would generally keep to myself and be quiet. I would speak to her a lot and then go back to my room when other people came home. I didnt like going to the shops or visiting family. Id eat alone in my room. At nursery, I refused to do star jumps because I thought they were stupid. When the teacher told my mum about this, she told them not to force me if I dont want to. 

I did comment that a lot of these things are actually signs of autism. But I can see how it would be easy to just go why is it a problem that she likes to be alone?. I now have a weird appreciation for the fact that my parents saw me be a bit odd, refuse to speak to some people, refuse to participate in things, and went dont force her if she doesnt want to. I also appreciate that they accepted these traits as part of me and didnt see them as something that should be corrected, or even considered weird. 

I guess thats why I dont remember having meltdowns as a child. My family was accommodating and didnt force me into uncomfortable situations that would cause them. They didnt try to make me into something I wasnt.

Edit: I didnt expect this much of a response. Ive enjoyed reading through all of your experiences. Im also glad so many of you were able to relate to what I said, and that it let some people look at things from a different perspective.

But I think its not okay to be unkind to kids or teens, even if they might be exaggerating their symptoms or - in some rare cases - entirely faking them. IF they are faking anything clearly they have issues in the first place. 

For context, I just got diagnosed with ASS recently, a couple of weeks ago. I know that exposure to too much Negative talk about fakers or wannabe autistics nearly halted my diagnosis process in its tracks. Only because I had an autistic relative who believed me and encouraged me to go through with it, I did. I was kinda scared that I was faking it subconsciously.

They start coming out every march/april until may/june, and then they close up their hole in the wall until the following spring.

Tomorrow renovation works are starting on my part of the building - which is fair enough, the building needs it - but the bees are not going to survive it.

I've been trying to get the ones that have already hatched to move into a different spot by offering them blocks of hardwood with pre-drilled holes and bought insect hotels, but they didn't go for it.

I just went outside to check again, and when I shone my flashlight into their nest, I saw a little fluffy bee with pollen stuck to its legs getting comfy for the night, and it broke me.

The city didn't get back to me. The landlord didn't get back to me. The construction people don't care. Only I seem to care, and I have failed them. I can't save them. Even if I managed to forcibly remove them all from the wall without hurting them, which is basically impossible, their chances of survival would be miniscule.

Wild bees are so important for our eco system, and we really aren't in a position to be killing any of them. And those bees have been my friends for so long. It breaks my heart.

**Edit:** Thank you for your compassion and kind words! Seeing you care about the bees means a lot. Renovation works have started, and I can only hope that all my bees have hatched and made it out.

My 9yo son was diagnosed as autistic (after a loooong journey thinking he had ADHD like his older brother and dad). After a lot of research and online tests, it seems I might be autistic too (lovely thing to find out at 44 - better late than never?). 

My question is, were any of you gifted in school? I was identified as gifted in kindergarten, and the school tested me and my parents met with a child psychologist. My (narcissistic) mothers only recollection was that the psychologist was mean to her and people were soooo impressed with how well-spoken I was at 5. I believe I might have even had an IEP, but learned making so well that no one ever suspected I was autistic after elementary school. 

My assumption is that the school and psychologist may not have used the word autistic, but probably signaled that I would need social-emotional support and my mother blocked out ANY negative feedback and was just like my daughter is brilliant. 

I doubt that my school has records from 39 years ago, and from what Ive read and how hard it was to get a diagnosis for my son, I dont know that pursuing a diagnosis for myself makes sense. I believe Ive engaged in masking with every therapist Ive had, so I dont really want to go back to therapy (no wonder I found it exhausting.

You don't need to read my ramblings unless interested! I would not take offense to skipping over my ramblings haha.

Basically, I spend a lot of time creating really detailed ""systems"" and ""processes"" for doing something. It's like something clicks in my mind and I'm like ""ahhh!! this would be the best way to do this!!"" and then i spend far too much time trying to set things up so that I can always do them that way in the future. But what I've found is that most of the processes just do not work  for more than one specific thing and end up being hard to implement in the future.. and then I have a really hard time trying to figure out how to alter my process to include the changes for a slightly different situation and then i get overwhelmed and stressed because i wasted my time making the system to begin with.

Oh also i suppose I should add that im also ADHD so my propensity to immediately abandon any sort of structure is absolutely sky high!

I feel like I'm not explaining this well lol.. but I'm trying not to be too specific because I know I do this with a lot of things not just the specific scenario im currently referencing. But basically what I'm directly referring to is working on a computer publishing/design program that has lots of features. I am very familiar with this program but I find that I still get overwhelmed with it because there are so many options and processes to work through. So i get very overwhelmed by it but then when I see even the smallest opportunity to make the process more efficient, i will spend hours and extreme amounts of my *limited* brain power setting up *said* process and then later abandon it because it really only works for the specific thing im working on at the time. I suppose I just desperately want to have a way to make things easier on myself and have a strict process to follow instead of every time having to spend so much brain power working through it.

Idk.. I'm just interested to see if anyone else has this situation where you constantly look for the most efficient method of doing something. Im not sure that the body of my post correctly relayed my thoughts on the broader topic that im asking about, but hopefully you get what i mean.

I remember very vividly this one time: I mustered up the courage to go to a local cafe that was buzzing with both aged locals and young people like me. I was happy when I went in. I was upset when I left. 

Why? Because I saw the barista act all loving and cute and sweet to the lady in front of me because she had makeup on, hair curled, dress on, accessories perfect. Then the barista sees me, a girl who came out by herself, no makeup, ugly face, hair slicked back in a bun, and her demeanour changes. Immediately. She treats me like sh\*t. She starts grunting. She curls her lips in disgust when she is forced to look at me to take my change. I leave feeling like less of the person I am, but I force out a chipper ""Thank you!

The only way to avoid people treating me like dogsh\*t every time I go out, is if I cake myself in makeup. Or if I start sucking up to them. Why?

Although we may be able to function in our daily lives, the labor of constantly maintaining a fake personality can drain on our mental and physical health. Autistic people sacrifice a lot, beyond just anxiety; many of us develop poor coping mechanisms like substance abuse or eating disorders to feel a sense of normalcy. Being able to accept and love who you are as a person is a key first step to become happier and healthier.

Same as my last post, all these tables and information come from the book 'Unmasking Autism' by Devon Price (highly recommend).

How do people cope and prop up the mask? There are some main categories, as well as the intrinsic reasons that autistic people reach for these coping methods.

&gt;**Warning**: some may have triggers associated with certain coping mechanisms. Please don't read if you aren't in a good headspace to think about negative coping strategies (there are no explicit descriptions). Scroll to where it says ""End of content warning"" if you want to skip this.

**Problem Drinking &amp; Substance Abuse**

* Dulls sensory sensitivities
* Provides ""liquid courage"" for social situations
* Relaxes inhibitions and filters
* Provides energy to make it through an overly demanding world
* Stimulates the senses
* Entertains an anxious or racing mind
* Silences the inner critic

**Eating-disordered Behavior**

* Grounds life in daily goals and rituals
* Provides physical stimulations
* Distracts from social struggles by focusing on the body
* Defines ""goodness"" or ""worthiness"" in terms of behavior or appearance
* Gives the autistic person a sense of self-control or discipline
* Explains away feelings of dysphoria or physical dissociation

**Detachment and Dissociation**

* Prevents rejection by disengaging first
* Blunts painful emotions like grief, sorrow, or regret
* Allows the autistic person to focus only on what they're ""good"" at
* Removes the pressure to learn challenging emotional and social skills
* Silences needs and emotions others may find annoying
* Preserves limited energy

**Adherence to Rigid Rules/Belief Systems**

* Makes a confusing reality more understandable and concrete
* Translates vague social norms into specific expectations
* Creates an in-group to which the autistic person can belong
* Provides daily structure and soothing rituals
* Soothes self-doubt and fears about being a ""bad person""
* Promises salvation or relief from the present, unjust world

**""Fawning""/Compulsive People Pleasing**

* Earns the autistic person praise
* Offers a false promise of acceptance
* Simplifies complex relationship dynamics
* Flattens social interactions into one easy rule: ""Always say yes""
* Validates the autistic person's belief that they should ignore their own feelings and needs
* Minimizes conflict or anger

Try to reach for comfort and happiness without falling into these coping mechanisms. Being aware of your own tendencies is an important step for treatment and moving forward.

Everything makes so much sense, everyone of my childhood memories are being rewritten. I told a friend you dont seem autistic, why would you want to identify with something negative? And it made me sad. This isnt something negative, this is something that finally makes me feel ..normal if you will. 

Reading all these journal articles, threads and TikToks, all I can do is think about autism now even in my sleep. Which is no big deal cause its like okay cool this is my current obsession.

So I call my sister - 18 months apart - we have never been close. Growing up was really hard. I told her I think I have autism we hung up &amp; she did research on it. 

She calls me back in tears and tells me she feels so sorry for how she treated me and if she knew she would have been more patient. We cried for 2 hours, and processed our childhood.  I didnt expect her reaction

Because of that, I was always accepted by others and I think I learned to mask literally every aspect of my true self to the point that I barely even know who my true self is. 

This sounds SO obnoxious and I dont know how to say it in a way that doesnt sound it so bear with me, but I feel like I was made to believe that autistic people look unusual/different(?) or visibly autistic(?) and just couldnt even fathom anyone pretty/normal(?) looking being autistic& (Again, I dont know how to say that in a nicer way and I mean it all as neutrally as possible, so sorry if Im being offensive at all.) 

This also makes it so that a lot of people do not believe me when I say Im autistic, and thats just insanely annoying. 

Anyways, just wondering if anyone else can relate? Would love to hear your thoughts!

ETA: I realized I didnt properly wrap up/tie everything together. Basically I feel like being conventionally attractive led to people expecting me to act a certain way, which led to me molding my personality to those who I looked up to and led me to mask a lot of my true/autistic traits, which led me to have no idea I was autistic whatsoever until my psychiatrist brought it up. Like, I literally didnt even know I was masking until I learned Im autistic. Im wondering if anyone has experienced something similar?

In which case, I apologize ahead of time, but I just feel like I need to get this off my chest.

Like most people here, I have a lot of sensory issues, especially noise. Because of this, I do not like being around kids under a certain age and I choose not to be whenever possible. They scream, they are unpredictable, they can't control their bodily fluids as easily, and they're often sticky with god knows what. I also have no maternal instincts and a very flat affect tone and I hate that you're expected to act way more animated and cutesy when you're around little kids. For these reasons I just have no desire to ever be around children. Even my friends' kids, tbh (as terrible as that sounds).

I've noticed a growing number of people in feminist spaces saying that it's sexist to not like children, and that we should just deal with them and put on noise-canceling headphones. It's not a personal attack on mothers, I just don't want to be around little kids and I wish people would respect us ND people when we say that.","AutismInWomen",265,"https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismInWomen/comments/13hjeb5/is_anyone_else_here_insanely_triggered_by_children/"

Being Autistic has taken so much from me, my dream of being a mother, a doctor and so much more all stripped away from me. It's ruined friendships, potential relationships even my relationship with my family is gone as a result. 

It makes working unbelievably painful, it means I'm exhausted all the time, it means I can't even enjoy my special interests which causes more distress. 
It makes basic things like eating and hygiene the most challenging task in the world, it means neglecting myself or staying up for 20+ hours because I'm so engrossed in whatever I'm fixed on. It means spending irrationally on a special interests and so much more. 

And not to mention how cruel this world is towards us, especially if you cannot mask.

Context: I've been seeing the same therapist every week for nearly 6 years, and we have a great relationship. I would definitely consider her a corrective experience for me. We've done CBT, DBT, and EMDR together. That's why this story is so deeply shocking to me. Also, I've suspected I was autistic since 2017.

One week ago I was finally formally diagnosed with autism. It was not what I was expecting, but it happened nonetheless. I went to therapy this week (yesterday) after a few weeks of a break as my therapist was out of office. First thing in the session, I told my therapist about the autism diagnosis and she& she was horribly ableist to me and said things to me I was sure she would never say . It was like I was suddenly in the room with a different person than I've known all this time.

She was ranting, literally ranting! about how calling it a spectrum and putting people like me on the same spectrum as people like her friends son who is in diapers and bangs his head against the wall only hurts everyone on the spectrum. She kept using the term ""low functioning"" and when I (gently) suggested high/low support needs or high/low masking she said very aggressively retorted people like him cant mask!

At one point I told her that she was using an ableist slur (the most confrontational I got because I felt like a child being scolded and was visibly shaking and crying is distress) and she just said Im not being ableist, Im stating the truth.

She went to great lengths to describe how I do not have ""medium"" support needs. Point for point just a total dismissal of my support issues (I have a caregiver who helps me daily) and I looked her dead in the eye and said Im disabled (I recently got SSDI benefits (huge win for me!)) and thats when I realized, she doesn't think I *am* disabled.

My shattered trust and deep sense of betrayal here have caused me to reevaluate many of the things she's said, and I'm coming to some sad conclusions. I've realized that she thinks my disability is just a part of my learned helplessness. It also makes sense why she never thought I would get disability benefits and told me that time and time again

(literally every time I brought it up for two years).

I almost walked out, but somehow I steered the convo back to something else and we had therapy like normal for the rest of the hour. That part was helpful. After a day of thinking on it, I'm still all over the place. I feel like one 15 minute rant can't be enough to throw away our 6 year therapy relationship, but also this is my identity we're talking about. If it was about my race or gender identity and she held these types of beliefs, there's no way I'd be able to face her again. But a part of me is terrified she's right, and that I'm not autistic enough, and that if I can just ""forget"" about the autism she can still help me. But I know how wrong that all sounds... I'm so stressed I cant even watch golden girls, y'all. What do you think?","AutismInWomen",202,"https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismInWomen/comments/1d4hxu9/therapist_shocked_me_with_rant_about_autism/"

Wanting to die **is not** an autistic trait. 

Wanting to ""just stop existing"" **is not** an autistic trait. 

If you're dealing with any feelings that you'd be better off dead or life is too difficult to live for any reason, please reach out to a clinician. That is much more consistent with the symptoms of PTSD or depression, which many many autistic people suffer from. 

Both PTSD and depression can be treated with therapeutic intervention (look up CPT especially for trauma). You don't have to carry that level of pain within yourself. 

**It is not an autistic trait to want to die because you have autism.** 

I strongly urge people in this community to avoid reinforcing the message that our lives are somehow less valuable because autism makes them more difficult. Carrying that message -- carrying the idea that other autistic people feel that way -- is dangerous for a suicidal person.

If you're concerned about healthcare costs: your quality of life is worth it. Many, many clinics in the US offer reduced rates for uninsured individuals or compassion discounts. Please don't give up on yourself. Your life has value *because* you're autistic, not in spite of it.

ETA: please scroll down for /u/TaciturnEngima's wonderful explanation for why autism can *lead* to developing depression or PTSD. If you fall into this group, I especially urge you to seek help. I blamed autism/myself instead of my abusers for years.

ETA2: you can go through and downvote my posts if you want to. I'm not sorry for encouraging people to seek care. If youre angry with me, I understand why. This is a painful and difficult conversation, and clearly I struck a nerve. It's a nerve I'll gladly keep hitting if it gets even one person here to see they have more options than suffering and dying alone.

Im in grad school. A classmate of mine gave a presentation in class about her work. Shes a psych student and her research is related to autism. Ive had classes with her before, and though weve never hung out outside of class, weve always gotten along quite well. This being the case, I dont think I can really classify her as a friend, but she was definitely a more positive acquaintance.

She doesnt know that Im autistic, I dont think. Since Im not formally diagnosed (yet) and this is a professional setting, I am really careful about who I talk to about being neurodivergent. Anyway. Her presentation was really, really offensive and now I cant help but feel a bit betrayed by this person that I previously had a positive relationship with.

The way she talked about autistic people was just so& dehumanizing and ableist. I get that its a scientific presentation, but still, it was deeply uncomfortable and honestly kind of made my skin crawl. Like, comparing us to animals, us vs them (in reference to NT and ND people, respectively), and stuff like that. It was obvious from the way that she was talking that she assumed that everyone in the room was NT, and talked about autistic people as if we werent (and couldnt possibly be in) this room full of scientists.

There were also things in her talk that were just& plain wrong? Like, the statement that autism is more prevalent in male humans. No. Its autism is more frequently diagnosed in male humans.

Or, people with ASD have impaired cognition compared to normal people. Neurotypical. The word youre looking for is neurotypical. Neurodiversity is natural and normal. And not all of us have intellectual disabilities& its a spectrum. Granted, this students first language is not English, but still.

Anyway. I felt really upset afterward and now I feel uncomfortable going back to that class. I cant believe that she talked about us that way.

Theyre a massive responsiblity. Children are loud, theyre messy, theyre demanding and they often dont cooperate. And they dont stop being that way ounce they grow out of childhood. The demands and the needs only change.

Kids are exspensive. They add an extra to cost to everything in your life.  More Food, more cloths, more heat, more having to put money aside for emergencies ect.

Being a parent is hard, physically, mentally and emotionally. You constantly have to put the childs needs and interests over your own. And when you struggle to meet even your own 
needs that can be absolute nightmare.

And IN MY OPINION, none of this is worth it. None of this worth bringing a helpless child into this f-ckd up world. Or having mini me or a legacy project, which seems to be the most common reason people want children.

"397","Lessons Ive learnt from hanging out with a fellow autistic","2023-03-26",1679815010,"Lessons Ive learnt from hanging out with a fellow autistic","Edit: I just wanted to say thank you to all of you for your lovely comments. I showed this post and the comments to C, and he also thinks youre all awesome. Also, upon reading some of the comments, I have changed some of the terminology that I used in my original post - namely, I have swapped the terms NT (neurotypical) and ND (neurodivergent) with allistic and autistic, respectively.



I wanted to share my experience of befriending a fellow autistic person, and how much it has improved my life.

I met my friend C on Tinder about two months ago. He was visiting my country from the USA, so I took him on a date at a cool little gin bar in my city. Looking back, we connected more like brother and sister than lovers, but, because in my experience with dating allistic people, dates usually end with sex, I offered to go home with him. We were halfway there when he said he didnt feel a spark and asked if we could call it off. I said yes, but asked if hed like to remain friends, because he seemed like a very interesting person. He said yes, and, after that, we began hanging out regularly.

He was very upfront from the beginning that he was autistic, and just witnessing him being himself has allowed me to develop a much greater understanding of who I am and how my own autism manifests. We would just do things depending on how either of us felt; sometimes we would go to comedy clubs or museums, and sometimes he would just come over to my place with his laptop, and we would sit side by side on the couch, both working and not talking. It was wonderful.

Those times when C visited me in my home are very precious memories to me, because he never masks around me, and it gave me the confidence to unmask around him. Hes very unapologetically himself, and doesnt care much for social cues; if hes hungry, he just raids my fridge; if hes tired, he lays down on my bed; he doesnt hide his stimming, and its so refreshing. I never have to worry about accidentally saying the wrong thing and offending him because I cant figure out the secret code that allistic people seem to speak in. My close family member, who is allistic, doesnt understand our relationship, and doesnt get why we arent dating; they said this after I told them I was feeling overwhelmed and on the verge of meltdown, so C and I just cuddled on the couch and watched *Jeopardy*. What I tried to explain (not very successfully) is that there was nothing romantic about it; I just needed to be held to calm down, I told that to him, and he held me, because hes a good friend.

C and I are currently travelling in Southeast Asia together for just under a month. We are staying at separate places; he has his own hotel room up the road, and I am staying in a hostel. Again, my family member doesnt understand how we can be travelling together but not dating, or why we wouldnt stay together, but this setup works perfectly for us. We meet up most days for breakfast or dinner, and sometimes we do activities together, but if either of us needs space or solitude, the other just does their own thing. Its perfect. Yesterday, he messaged me and said that he had found something to do that he thought I would get a lot of value out of, and he took me to do my first ever saltwater floatation tank. It was the closest Ive ever felt to true bliss, and I would highly recommend it for all autistic peoplethe lack of sensory input is divine.

Befriending C was one of the best things I ever did, and has really helped me to accept myself unconditionally, and to understand myself. I have lots of allistic friends, but getting to know a fellow autistic has been absolutely wonderful in that I can just be myself and be understood. I would highly recommend making more friends on the spectrum if you can.","AutismInWomen",75,"https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismInWomen/comments/122ea7f/lessons_ive_learnt_from_hanging_out_with_a_fellow/"

- I work in a office/warehouse, my job is sitting at a desk and typing on a computer all day. 


- I copy data from medical records into our database (all things medical are my biggest special interest!)


- I work in complete silence and often go my entire day without speaking to a single person.


- Headphones are not only allowed but very encouraged 


- My routine is the exact same, every day, down to the minute. It never, ever deviates. Nothing unexpected ever happens. 


- I get 3 breaks in a 9 hour shift (one every 3 hours)


- The warehouse is employed by 90% women. Ive only seen 3 men in our entire building.


- My coworkers are so nice and respectful, always professional which makes it so much easier to socialize. 


- The woman that sits across from me is also autistic, we talk occasionally which is cool.

"404","Grieving the Fact that I'll Never Be ""That"" Girl","2024-02-05",1707157747,"Grieving the Fact that I'll Never Be ""That"" Girl","While scrolling Instagram last night I came across a friend's story. She is an acquaintance of mine that I've known for about 10 years, we worked together briefly, waiting tables in a mountain town. 

We've gotten lunch a handful of times over the years, but not since well before she was engaged and married. Nowadays our friendship extends only as far as liking each other's stories and posts. The relationship ran its course, as many do, and that's okay.

Last night she had posted a reel of her and a group of girls having a cozy, tea-drinking, book reading meetup on a snowy day. The camera panned to all the girls in yoga pants or pjs, big comfy sweaters, and oversized mugs for cocoa and tea. It showed their snack counter, full of goodies for a winter day. 

My heart broke. Not because I expected to be invited, I  didn't. As mentioned before, this was a relationship that naturally fizzled out over time, but I like to think we still have respect for each other. 

No, my heart broke because as hard as I tried, and as long as I tried to mimic and mime, I was never that girl. Never the girl that could stand to be in a big group let alone maintain that many relationships. But it seems so comforting, and that's where I ache. To have a consistent support group over years and years, to know on a snowy day you won't be having burnout and have to cancel plans last minute. To know you can have more than 3 friends at your wedding and not be wondering the entire time if they're there out of pity.  To sit around with a group of women and chat about anything and nothing and not see side-eyes of judgement. 

I remember meeting a group of her friends one time, I went over to her house for her birthday. I walked in and one of her college friends gave me the awful, inhumane, look from toe to head. You know the one, where they want you to know where you stand in the pecking order.   
Later my friend and I sat in the corner catching up, and she told me how her and her clique collectively ""pushed out"" someone that didn't vibe with them.   
I only saw my friend once more after that incident, and I can't help but wonder if I failed a test somehow. 

I'm unsure if that's the same group from the video last night-- but the only peace I give myself is that *that* is how The Others operate. That it's based on some level of dislike and inauthenticity, and that's why I can't and won't ever be like them. 

At least, that's what I'll tell myself for today.

Well, we need to squeak. 


It's unfair because what the world wants from girls and women are opposites.


When we are girls - especially - with Autism we are groomed to replace Autistic tendencies like shyness and neediness with masking and ""high functioning"". We are supposed to be little mini adults.


Weirdly, people don't want that from us as actual adults though. We're too powerful like that. Being high ""functioning"" is wrong in adulthood because the Patriarchy says women are supposed to be a little pathetic, or at least shy and needy. What I've chosen to do is to fall back on some of my earlier states before the ""low needs"" grooming set in, see if I can cultivate some of the other end of the spectrum traits like shyness/stand-off-ishness and, yes, neediness.


I'd be playing into what the Patriarchy wants me to look like a bit, but I already am anyways. Both sides are working against women, being strong and independent was never a role that all women should've been forced into, especially considering that's a lot of what we went through as children (especially if Oldest Daughter Syndrome is a factor).


Anyways, I know this is going to be controversial, and this is just a discussion on *low support needs* not discounting the existance of ""real"" high support needs. Not saying they're just ""acting"" high needs. Not saying they didn't get groomed like we did, there is a real level of disability factor, some of us could push ourselves to conform to the ""low needs"" standards, and some couldn't.  Both are excruciating experiences and this post is not to compare or compete. 


This post is **only** to help other ""low needs"" women see where they might've been set up against themselves and adjust accordingly.


Self advocating is a huge part of our shared experience no matter the support needs level, and maybe us low needs need to take a hard look at that ""self"" and maybe start advocating for a Self that is a deeper understanding of ourselves and our real needs.","AutismInWomen",229,"https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismInWomen/comments/1b3wlbn/when_low_support_needs_are_just_women_who_were/"

(Yes, I'm friggin' exhausted.) One of my colleagues, we'll call him ""Ed,"" is someone I try to interact with as little as possible because he has a volatile temper and gets offended at just about everything. He attributes the worst possible intention to everything anyone does or says, and it's exhausting, so I do my best to steer clear of him as much as possible.

Another thing, for context, is that he regularly raises his voice and goes off on tirades in meetings. He and I used to sit in chairs next to each other, and I would watch the vein on his temple bulge out as he raged. And our supervisor just sits there and lets it happen while entire meetings and our work is derailed because of him.

Anyway, back to today. I was speaking with our supervisor about something different, and she changed the subject to let me know that sometimes, in meetings, it's apparent that I'm upset about something because I get a ""blank, faraway look"" in my eyes and I purse my lips. (That faraway look? Yeah, that's me recognizing my emotions, managing them, and thinking about how (or if) to respond in a reasonable, productive way. In other words, NOT yelling and derailing discussion.) She said that Ed has noticed, and it upsets him. She just wanted to make me aware.

I paused and kinda smiled and said, ""I'm not going to regulate my face for Ed's comfort. I have feelings, and that's okay. Would you rather me purse my lips and look away, or start yelling?"" She kinda stuttered in response. Then I said, ""I regulate my physical responses 100% of the time."" She laughed uncomfortably. But I didn't stop: ""No, I do. I constantly regulate how I present when I'm around people. And it's exhausting. I'm not adding 'regulate my face' to my list of things to control because Ed is upset I have feelings that I manage.""

She backed down. (Because she can't stand up to people asserting themselves, which is why Ed is given free rein.) But I'm just feeling so pissed about this. I know this isn't an ND/NT thing but more of a narcissist/abuser thing. Ed's just trying to control everything and everyone. But having once been in an abusive relationship where everything I did was wrong (I was too quiet; I talked to much; I was too emotional; I was too controlled; I dressed too sexy; I was wearing too many baggy clothes), this is really triggering for me.

I ask this because I was thinking about my journey with the concept of bullying. If you asked me at 15 if I had ever been bullied I would have said no because no one ever took money from me or anything, no one ever beat me up after school.

But as I got older I realised I was looking at it all wrong. It didnt have to be a cliche school house Tv scene to count as bullying. I went through my life just thinking a lot of peers and elder folk just didnt like me, were just mean, just assholes, but I didnt consider that they bullied me.

Me asking a guy (I thought I was on good terms with) politely to stop knocking a desk with his zipper only for his entire group of friends to do it louder? And laugh when I asked them to stop again?

The behaviour that was completely IGNORED in autistic boys when I was in school was one of the main reasons I didnt seek out a diagnosis. In primary school, a boy in the grade below me would do laps around the block of the school our grades shared and would literally PELT our bags and belongings at windows to try and get them smash them and, even when someone said: Hey, can I just get my stuff and bring it inside so he doesnt break it?, wed get the: He has autism. We just need to leave him alone spiel. A higher needs boy I went to high school with sent us into lockdown multiple times because he actually would break doors and windows and wed sometimes be sitting under our desks for up to an hour because, once again: He has autism. We just need to leave him alone. I already knew I was very different from all of the other kids, but hearing that they couldnt do anything to stop these kids because autism made me rule it out for so long and not seek out help because I had the impression that violent behaviour was just a part of autism and I was a super timid kid who wouldnt even speak unless I was spoken to, let alone try and hurt people.

Both things that happened to me in school would have had some kind of nasty effect on *everyone* who witnessed it (undiagnosed ND people = I cant be autistic. Id never hurt anyone, NT people = Wow, I guess autistic people are all psychos, huh?) and the video I watched just reminded me that the cycle is going to continue. People who dont understand ASD (undiagnosed or completely neurotypical people) are going to see that video and think: I cant have autism, Id never hurt my mom/autistic people are all monsters. because no one has the guts to say that hurting someone or something is completely unacceptable behaviour that isnt par for the course EVEN IF youre a boy with a developmental disability. Youre not actually protecting anyone by ignoring it or just trying to live with it, youre just 1) exposing them to more violence in the future and 2) perpetuating a really hurtful stereotype. 

ALSO, there was also a higher needs autistic girl who, in hindsight, was held to vastly different standards than the boys. One year, she made a g-n shooting gesture towards the camera during a group class picture and she wasnt permitted to spend any time outside of special ed for THE REST OF THE YEAR, but lockdown boy could come back to PE the next day like nothing happened.

I was shocked and honestly kind of offended when my therapist first brought up me possibly getting tested for autism a year ago, because I had only ever met autistic men in my lifetime and all of them were incredibly rude borderline incels who seemed to ignore social queues and boundaries out of entitlement rather than an  inability to understand the situation, and I was thinking oh gosh does my therapist really think Im like that??? I dont think I act like that. 

I did tons of research on autism to see if maybe my therapist was right and I should consider getting tested and at first I was watching videos on YouTube, reading articles, visiting subreddits, etc all about autism and I was still like Im not relating to any of this and then I realized that pretty much everything I was looking at was made by men or for men. I sort of went down this rabbit hole of trying to learn about autism from women and suddenly I was relating so much to everything. 

I was just really surprised that there was such a difference between the genders of autistic people. Is it just a difference of how parents tend to raise girls vs boys that causes this?

I have hashimoto's disease, celiac disease and hypothyroidism and currently am on a few different meds to help me be a normal person (physically). So the doctor asked about my conditions and did the whole ""ah yep, i know that one, are you on meds for that?"" and i said, ""yes, i'm on this med, and i'm also on this other med."" and he goes, ""okay. and they work for you?"" and i said ""well, when i am on the med #1 alone, it is mediocre. However, when i take med one and med two together, med two actually enhances the effects of med one."" and he paused and gave me a weird look  and i was like alright boy-o, buckle in because here we go. My usual doctor is awesome and knows i do this but this guy was new.   
  
Anyway, so off the top of my head i listed the research papers and medical journals i had read through just for fun and told him about how med one and med two actually have a moderate interaction and because of that, i need to be monitored closely so we don't accidentally turn my hypothyroidism into hyperthyroidism. I mentioned how the papers and journals had shown that med two exacerbates the effects of med one and can make it -too- effective and went on to explain how it all works to him. He just sat back and stared at me and after a moment said, ""wait..... so you read medical journals.... FOR FUN? .....even i don't do that and i'm a doctor. I can't believe you just do that for fun.... that's wild. I didn't even know those meds interacted. Crazy."" and i went on to explain to him how whenever my usual doctor talks about different conditions, she doesn't even have to give me information sheets or anything because she knows i have already gone and studied the shit out of it. She's the only doctor who actually seems to appreciate that. In the past i've had health professionals tell me off for even using terms like ""Root cause"" and ""comorbidity"" because i'm not actually qualified to use that terminology.

A couple of years ago, as we slowly started coming out of quarantine, I applied for an internship at a local lab. They called me for an interview, so I went in. I was lucky enough everyone was still wearing masks at the time, and hiding part of my face gave me a bit more confidence when interacting with the interviewer. 

However, we get to the end of the interview, and she suddenly springs a technical exam on me. Of course, I start panicking internally because Ive never had that before in an interview (its not really common in my industry). She gave me some bags filled with various items and labeled in different ways, and asked me to group them while being timed. That was pretty much the extent of her instructions; bare bones without any details. I get halfway through sorting the items the way that made the most sense to me before she remarks that Im supposed to be sorting them by ITEM and not NUMBER. So I had to go back and completely redo everything and of course I end up getting rejected for the position a few days later. She gave me absolutely no details other than to sort based on what made sense to me, only for the way I was doing it to be wrong apparently.

I couldn't stop laughing at how weirdly descriptive the term ""slug time"" was! He elaborated that sometimes I just needed to rest in a quiet , preferably dark space, laying down.

Our therapist apologised for not being informed or educated on neurodiversity, and suggested we look into finding someone who can support me more in therapy. She also asked my husband to do more research and learning himself on having an asd/adhd spouse. 

My husband also agreed to try using more words to describe how he is feeling or what he wants from me, because I can't be guessing and can't deal if he's getting mad and upset at me when I have no idea what he's feeling. (I wrote it in a comment somewhere, he wanted me to commiserate with him about the attic situation, but he never said anything to indicate he was disappointed or upset about the attic situation.

When I'm around people I am comfortable with, I often talk but nobody responds most of the time. This even happens with my close friends and family, I rarely talk this much with anyone else anyway.

Some examples of things I might say would be like making observations, or explaining why something is the way it is, or speaking what I'm thinking in regards to what we are doing. I noticed this happened a lot when my mom and brother were at my house helping me to fix my deck. They were doing most of the work, and I was helping and gathering tools for them, etc. Most of what I said they just ignored. It wasn't because they were too busy working, they were right next to me like trying to find a nail, for example. I had to repeat things multiple times before they'd answer me like ""I have more nails in the house, should I go get them?"" or ""Do you want me to hold this \_\_\_\_\_ while you do that?"" I felt like a little kid around the grownups, and I'm almost 50!

Another example would be like if I am at my friends house (they're a couple), and they'll be doing normal things in their house like people do (feeding their pets, preparing food, looking for something, etc.) and I'll say things and get ignored most of the time. I feel like since I'm the third wheel, what I say isn't as important, unless we're all in the middle of a conversation, this doesn't happen then, only when I talk when nobody else is talking to me. Like I am talking because I feel comfortable with them and I am kinda trying to start conversations but unless it's already a conversation then it isn't worth responding to. I hope this is making sense!

I'm not just blurting out random nonsensical things, they're usually related to what is happening. I just don't understand how in different groups of people this happens. I don't talk quietly either, I've been told I have a loud voice that carries well. So I know they heard me.

This video explains one of the reasons why. If any one of you don't know and I'm sure a lot of you don't. This is about a food critic going to a restaurant in Atlanta, the person said they had horrible customer service and posted it on tiktok. If you don't like tiktok for whatever reason..I don't care that's not the point. After the person made a review of the restaurant the owners of the restaurant wrote a comment saying that the reviewer is autistic so their opinion has no value. 

Being a black autistic person I've never been given any grace for being autistic. I've always been judged harshly by everyone. The reviewer has not said their autistic and I don't think they are but that's not the point of what I'm saying. I have not given any mercy from the point i was born being black and autistic. I just had to try to fit in or get bullied out of anything..a job, group setting at school or college, teachers have bullied me and I've even had a few people try to fight me and they were strangers.

I want to talk about it because I often see people from our community asking how we survive employment (and sometimes the opposite); truth is, most of us dont.

I work 40 hours a week in a field that I couldnt exactly call neurodivergent friendly (customer service and tourism; you get the gist). I am also a university student. Like everyone I have bills and rent to pay.

I do it all. Seriously, and I dont know how at this point because I feel like a ticking bomb, but I do it all.

I am not living for myself, I am just one of the many pawns that make world go round. But the pawn is defective, so its not worth keeping on the board. This is how society views us.

Sometimes I have brief moments of clarity (or delusion) where I suddenly trick myself into thinking that I am invincible, that I will recover and move forward.

Despite trying to clarify in advance about their instructions, things didn't go well at all. When I called ahead to understand what ""fasting"" meant for their tests, I was told not to eat or drink anything after midnight, except for taking my medication as usual. I specifically mentioned that I take Levothyroxine in the morning and was assured it was fine. Following their instructions, I only had a small amount of water with my medication before the appointment. That is relevant because normally I need to load up on 2-3 litres of water just to make drawing blood easier. However, this time I did not - as instructed.


Once there, the staff had difficulty drawing blood, and their frustration was evident. It felt unfair that they seemed annoyed with me for not drinking more water, when I followed their directive to have only a small amount to the letter. It seems they expected everyone to drink more, to know to drink more disregarding the directions - even though they said otherwise - but to stick to plain water. And they worded it like they did because otherwise NT people think sneaking in a coffee or a juice before the test in the morning is not that bad (it would be bad, makes glucose values useless). 

As someone who takes instructions seriously, this experience left me feeling disregarded and disrespected.

Ive also contacted a local advocacy group in our area who specialize in this sort of thing. Honestly, I wouldnt have thought of this without this group of amazing individuals. Thank you all so much. >√∂ 

My son is autistic and in kindergarten. He is in a functional learning class for special needs children in the local public elementary school. There are 2 other kindergarteners in there. The school has a K graduation the last day of school. 

I asked his teacher if the kindergarten graduation was still the last day and she told me the principal said that the functional class will have a separate Kindergarten graduation from the typical K class. 

I waited until after morning drop off and announcements to go to speak to him. 

He came out of his office to speak with me in the main office area. I asked him about the separate kindergarten graduations and he confirmed, yes they will be separate. I asked him why. 

He then tells me that he felt the functional kindergartens would disrupt the NORMAL kindergarten graduation and that wouldnt be fair to those parents. I lost it at normal kindergarten. 

I raised my voice and asked him if he thought discrimination was more appropriate than accommodation? And how the hell is it okay to exclude these children? He asked me to calm down and that made me lose it more. 

I started yelling at him that my child deserves to be treated fairly and even if he wouldnt sit through the graduation he should be allowed accommodations. And if the other parents knew he was excluding the special needs kids? I also told him he needs to read the ADA act. I said more but I started crying and shaking and pulling my hair. 

He called the resource officer in there to escort me to my car without any answering my questions. On the way out I was yelling accommodate dont discriminate! over and over. 

The resource officer told me that she agreed with me and she was sorry. I sat in my car rocking to calm myself down. I called my husband and he offered to get off work to come get me and talk to the principal. I didnt want him to miss work so I rocked more until I could drive.

After looking at him like I didn't understand, he said 'I thought you would like to deconstruct this'.

I got a big smile on my face. I don't know why, but that small action made me so happy. Maybe because people used to say it was weird. An him being ok with it, and even encouraging it, made me feel like I could be myself, just for a little bit.

I'm not heartbroken that's she's disabled, I'm heartbroken for her life.

I tried asking my husband questions about her afterwards. I thought if she liked zombie movies, we could get her a new movie or something. He didn't know anything about her. All he knew was that she was ""different"" and like zombies.

His culture is family orientated. Always big family events and get together and she's always invited. He's seen her 100s of times. He can write 1 sentence about who she is a person.

Her own brother, my father in law, sees her 4 times a week when he visit, cant add anything more. My husband asked him why does she like zombie movies and he didn't know. Basic questions that have no answer. I think it blew his mind, he's never even questioned who she is as a person. 

My husband said he's the best one out of the family with how they treat her. I've asked more questions about who she is after one visit than her entire family has in the last twenty years.

Husband thinks one of the brother may take care of her when Nonna dies but it's most likely she'll go to a home. Who is going to visit her? They only saw her because they were visiting Nonna. They can't even treat her like a person let alone family.

Is this how we treat people who don't fit in? Someone to say hello and goodbye to and nothing else.

I posted it into the women's empowerment Slack channel, and it immediately got 3 reactions. But within a minute of posting, the Senior Program Manager for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion messaged me to remove the post, and deleted it herself.

I'm fucking livid. The reason she gave makes no sense to me. She said that it should have been discussed with leadership, and something about needing to involve people from the neurodiversity affinity group, which is private because not everyone wants to be known for being neurodivergent. 

This is literally what she said:

""For a celebratory month, that should be posted in #enable and if you would like it cross promoted through ERGs it should be discussed with the ERG leadership team. If it was a general post, no worries at all, but being that we have an affinity group specifically for this community it feels disconnected not to bring them into the conversation and then partner with the ERGs to amplify it. Happy to discuss as we continue to meet with [fellow autistic man] who has taken a leadership role for the community on how best to partner and discuss how we can support the recoginition of months such as this.""

I responded with:

""I appreciate your thoughts. There is indeed an affinity group for neurodiverse individuals. However, its important to note that I am not speaking on behalf of the group; I am speaking from my own personal experience. As an autistic individual, I am self-advocating for more awareness and acceptance of autism in the workplace, particularly among women who are often underdiagnosed and misrepresented. I hope you understand that it is not appropriate to tell me, an autistic individual, that I should not talk about autism unless it has been approved by ERG leadership. I encourage you to continue meeting with [fellow autistic man] in your efforts to support neurodiversity inclusion in the future. Nevertheless, I must inform you that your comment was antithetical to inclusion, and it has left me feeling appalled and offended.""

The fucking irony of this person who is supposed to be in charge of INCLUSION telling me I cannot talk about a condition that I LIVE WITH. Unfuckingbelievable. I'm so angry I'm shaking.

EDIT: She responded, it's really long. 

Hey [my name] - thanks so much for your thoughtful response. I want to first say that by no means was my ask meant to downplay, defeat, or minimize your experience as a woman with autism. I completely respect all that you've done to advocate not only for yourself, but for the collective neurodiverse community here at [company] You have been incredible in your suggestions and honest in your approach.

My ask was based on your being one of the driving forces - actually the first person to reach out to me about supporting the neurodiverse community - and your wanting to help lead on planning support, activations, and generally more focus on the community - I believe you were actually the one to connect [fellow autistic man] and I. Being that you were/are in a place of leadership in helping to curate what that interaction looks like for the community and our extensive conversations prior to this, we agreed to share resources, ideas, activities, announcements, etc through the enable channel community (and once created the neurodiverse channel) on things important to this community to drive engagement and conversation. My ask, again from the view point of your being a leader in this space, was to share in that channel and partner with the ERGs to amplify your message. In that way, you'd reach more [employees], gain support from the different communities, AND build momentum in celebrating the focus of the month.

Let me be clear: this was NOT asking you not to talk about autism, nor about your experiences as an autistic woman at [company].

However, if you want to share your post simply as [an employee] at [company], that's totally fine. That was not my impression from our last conversation and the notes I took, but I am completely supportive of you sharing your post. My ask in this way, however, would still be to engage with the [disability channel] as that is one of the sole purposes of that community.

Description (this was updated in January and reposted today):
Community for [employees] living with seen (physical), unseen (e.g. neurodiverse, immuno-compromised, sensory) differing abilities, and supportive allies. Disability exists on a spectrum, as does the language that our community uses.

I hope this helps convey the reason for my ask and again, I apologize if this made you feel unseen or unappreciated - that was not at all my intention. Please let me know if you'd like to connect further or simply want to talk about where you are on things. Hope you have a great rest of your week!","AutismInWomen",154,"https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismInWomen/comments/12axls6/i_posted_about_autism_acceptance_month_at_work/"

I left my appointment feeling so happy, validated, and  hopeful for the future.

When I called my husband to share the news, the first thing he said was, ""Wow, I sure know how to pick 'em."" I asked him what he meant, and he said it was a joke.

During dinner that night, I asked him to explain the joke to me and he couldn't. He said it was just ""funny to him."" I explained that, to my knowledge,  people use that phrase when they've chosen something bad; so, does he feel he made a bad choice by marrying an autistic woman? He said no, that's why it's a joke. 

I suspect that his comment was a slip of the tongue that revealed his true feelings about my diagnosis, and I feel incredibly hurt.

Could anyone here give me a reality check? Was it a joke that I'm just not getting, and therefore I should forget about it? Or is this a red flag about my husband and the future of our relationship?

For context, we've been in a relationship for 12 years, married for 6 years, and we have a 2 yo daughter together.


Edit: Wow! I didn't expect to get so much feedback so quickly. To answer some common questions:

-We generally don't tease each other, so there isn't a history of deprecating humor between us. I would say our senses of humor are very different, and I often have a hard time understanding why he finds things funny/not funny.

-He doesn't have a history of relationships with autistic people (romantic or otherwise).

-To me, his tone sounded surprised when he made the comment, but I'm not sure I trust myself to interpret tone very accurately.

-When we discussed the comment over dinner, he did apologize, but only in an ""I'm sorry you feel that way"" sense.

-Our marriage isn't in a great place right now. We've really struggled to adjust to all the changes associated with becoming new parents recently. So maybe with that backdrop, I'm more likely to take his ""joke"" the wrong way.

Reading all your perspectives has been so enlightening, and I feel so much better. Even just seeing that there isn't a strong consensus one way or the other is really helpful. Given everyone's comments, I'm going to discuss this in our next couple's therapy session, and hopefully we'll be able to bring the issue to a healthy resolution.

I was a shell of a person for a long time. Desperate to be accepted, to be seen as ""enough"" or ""lovable"" but couldn't properly connect with people

I had my own ideas of fun, I care deeply about stuff no one seems to think about

I so often got told ""you're overthinking it""

I was miserable from about 6 years old, I was bullied and friendless all through school. I could never ""act right"" (I wasn't bad, just..a really weird kid)

It turns out when the first time you feel truly accepted by someone turns out to sociopathic abuser that'd threaten to kill and you nearly die because of them it leaves you and your brain totally broken 

BPD is considered one of the most painful mental illnesses to have, with 1 in 10 death rate, substance abuse, 80-90% sh rate, some unable to work, unable to have friends or a support network...

Imagine how seen I felt seeing those numbers and finally being told ""yes, you are seriously ill. You need serious help""

Then when I get said help, I fall apart.

None of the therapy clicked for me. It didn't make sense, I kept being sat in a zoom call with everyone nodding their heads like ""makes total sense"" and I'm like ""...I don't understand""

Then a few weeks in I get a call

""You've been referred for an autism and adhd assessment""

I never asked or suggested one, I never mentioned them but they referred me after everything I'd been telling them

They gave me screening tests and all of them told me I desperately need this assessment. If they could, they'd probably have diagnosed me there

""Yeah, often women are misdiagnosed with bpd when it's actually autism""

I'm still waiting for my assessment. After going full mask off when meeting my now partner and researching it online, I am so heart broken

Is this why nothing has ever made sense? Why I can't connect with people?

My parents nearly lost their shit when I told them I've been referred. They fully accepted I have bpd. A severe mental illness with a high death rate but completely denied I could be autistic

They fully believe the NHS were getting paid to assess me

""You're not autistic, you're normal""

They'd rather me be ""crazy"" than disabled

I cannot imagine how many folks (especially women) ""with bpd"" are actually just people losing their goddamn minds because no one is understanding them or is on the same page as them and they can't understand why so they must be bad and unlovable

The amount of rejection I've been through, the bullying, the abuse...all because I might be autistic?

Note: the author emphasizes that lists are sometimes unclear and vague, and that women with autism can feel male autism traits and vice versa, or any combination thereof. This is not a definitive list, but some of you might relate to these. 

**Traits commonly associated with Female Autism:**

**Emotional:**

Strikes others as emotionally immature and sensitive.

Prone to outbursts or crying, sometimes over seemingly small things.

Has trouble recognizing or naming their feelings.

Ignores or suppresses emotions until they bubble up and explode.

May become disturbed or overwhelmed when others are upset, but uncertain how to respond or support them.

Goes blank and seems to shut down after prolonged socializing or when overstimulated.

**Psychological:**

Reports a high degree of anxiety, especially social anxiety.

Is perceived by others as moody and prone to bouts of depression.

May have been diagnosed with mood disorder such as bipolar disorder, or personality disorders such as borderline or narcissistic personality disorder, before autism was discovered.

Fears rejection intensely and tries to manage how other people feel to avoid it.

Has an unstable sense of self, perhaps highly dependent on the opinions of others.

**Behavioral:**

Uses control to manage stress: follows intense self-imposed rules, despite having an otherwise unconventional personality.

Is usually happiest at home or in a familiar, predictable environment.

Seems youthful for their age, in looks, dress, behavior, or interests.

Prone to excessive exercise, calorie restriction, or other eating disorder behaviors.

Neglects physical health until it becomes impossible to ignore.

Self soothes by constantly fidgeting, listening to repetitive music, twirling hair, picking at skin or cuticles, etc.

**Social:**

Is a social chameleon: adopts the mannerisms and interests of the groups theyre in.

May be highly self educated, but will have struggled with social aspects of college or their career.

Can be very shy or mute, yet can become very outspoken when discussing a subject they are passionate about.

Struggles to know when to speak when in large groups or at parties.

Does not initiate conversations but can appear outgoing and comfortable when approached.

Can socialize, but primarily in shallow, superficial ways that may seem like a performance. Struggles to form deeper friendships.

Has trouble disappointing or disagreeing with someone during a real time conversation.","AutismInWomen",396,"https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismInWomen/comments/y5nj2p/i_am_reading_unmasking_autism_and_the_author/"

"531","47","2022-05-31",1654020375,"Last week, I brought up an autism assessment with my psychiatrist for the second time. The first time, he told me I cant be autistic because I dont speak in a monotone voice. During this visit, he told me I cant be autistic because Im a good communicator.","I told him that there exists a generation of girls and women just like me who fell through the cracks who always knew we were different, but couldnt pinpoint how. We were dismissed as weird, anxious, rude, cold bitches. Weve suffered in silence our whole lives. He said a cornerstone of autism is the inability to communicate.
He didnt know that Id been preparing for this for 8 months. Learning. Practicing my phrasing. Consciously unmasking my traits. I said it wasnt a cornerstone for all autistic people, as ASD exists on a spectrum.

He asked if I was aware of my communication skills. I said yes. He kept harping on it, so I gave him some context. I began reading at age 3. I was the youngest in my schools history to be in the gifted program. Ive spent years in therapy as an adult working on my communication.

He responded by saying maybe its narcissism. Maybe youre a narcissist.
He said this after Id told him about my 11 years of emotional, physical, and sexual abuse at the hands of narcissistic partners. After Id told him about autistic masking. After telling him how often girls + women go undiagnosed.
And that was his response.

I said Im giving you information to help you help me. Women are allowed to be confident in their abilities. We dont have to go through life hating ourselves for existing.

He said youre bragging about your IQ and how youre smarter than everyone else.
I was stunned.

I provided him pertinent contextual information and he called it bragging.
I asked him if he was aware of the updated guidelines for ASD that were published in Marchs update of the DSM-5.
He said listen& I dont think you have autism.

I replied so thats a no. If youre not interested in helping me and dismissing me as a narcissist altogether, then Id like to be pointed in the direction of someone who isnt using a DSM-5 from the 90s.

This, among other reasons, is why autistic people are at a higher risk of suicide. The misogyny in the mental health field is insurmountable. His interests werent in helping me find answers it was in compensating for his lack of knowledge and Napoleon complex by being argumentative.
Because of his flippant dismissals in the past, I had the wherewithal to record this appointment legal in my state.
I am so glad I did, because this appointment was the most despicable display of gaslighting and misogyny that Id ever endured by a so-called professional.

Hes been reported. Ive requested, in writing, both his differential diagnosis and his refusal of treatment.
Im keeping the audio file for my records. I asked to be referred to someone else.
This is the last time Ill let some grossly misinformed misogynistic man give me health advice.

Things that seemed easy for others were hard for me. Every day was a challenge &amp; I was always unprepared. I struggled to make friends &amp; rarely maintained friendships I did make. I could never grasp social ques or standards. I was irritable, emotional &amp; overwhelmed. I was labeled as a difficult, defiant child. I was told to try harder when I was already trying as hard as I could. I was told to behave when I behaved the only way I knew how. I was constantly being reminded that I was not the same as my peers.  I was bullied. I came home crying because no one wanted to be my friend. Teachers belittled me, adults scolded me &amp; peers isolated me. So, I belittled myself, I scolded myself, &amp; I isolated myself. I began to believe that I was broken, that I didnt deserve to be loved, &amp; that I was the problem. I allowed the ghostly version of myself that others created to haunt me for the first 25 years of my life. I became a timid, meek shell of the person I was created to be. After a complete emotional breakdown in my mid-20s, I decided to set myself free of the weight I was carrying. This is when I began to suspect that I was autistic. I allowed myself to heal, gave myself grace, forgave those who hurt me &amp; forgave myself.
 
My story and others like it are why autism acceptance is so important. Late diagnosed autistics grow up hating themselves because there is little understanding of autism. We &amp; others are aware that we are different. It is not enough to just be aware of someones differences, we need others to accept that we are different &amp; understand why to create a safer environment for autistic children and adults.
 
I am not blaming those around for not realizing I was 
autistic. Just like myself, they were unequipped with the knowledge needed to make me feel accepted. I commend them for loving &amp; encouraging me the best they could. Yet again, this is why autism acceptance is so important.

**QUICK NOTE FOR ANY NEW (PARTICULARLY MALE) READERS: If you've come here to talk all about how messed up this is towards cis men, but then don't read all of this post or any of the comments that are filled with around 100+ women on the spectrum expressing the same concerns that feelings I am... why am I supposed to humor your feelings when you literally aren't even considering ours?

If you're here to argue about your rights to post without considering OUR rights to feel safe (I'd at least have something to say for you if you were advocating for both) then kick rocks. The age of giving you what you need and it not being both sides sacrificing is slowly coming to its end in many women-centric subs and spaces. So many dudes have come from this hitting r/all that A.) wouldn't even normally post in a subreddit for *autistic women*, so this ban shouldn't even affect them, and B.)

I want YOU to do the emotional work and labor to make me feel included while all I have to do is whine in this comment."" Look up the concept of a safe space. Touch grass. It's funny how if men have a problem with us closing the space because men have invaded it before and been a ""bad apple"", and you supposedly care so much, get on top of the bad apples in this comment section maybe? Hold other men accountable? But no, you want us to do that for you too. Not a single guy has done that. But you want US to? That's how I can tell most of you don't care about women. You dont *care* about bad apples, but are just posturing as if you're upset in good faith. You just want control.**

**Now, onto the actual post:**

I don't care how draconian that sounds. Take a deep look at the comments of [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismInWomen/comments/x5jbak/what_is_this_manic_pixie_girl_trope_and_how_do_i/) to understand why I'm even suggesting this.

**EDIT: Its been brought to my attention that the poster in the linked thread has began editing his comments. Keep that in mind if you decide to go back and read through.**

Not only is the post incredibly low-effort, but if you look at his comments, this guy is just here to stroke his ego. Here are a few of his comments:

&gt;I dont mean this the wrong way but it sounds like as long as Im a decent person, who can value the details of an individual,  
&gt;  
&gt;I already have a potentially extreme advantage in the dating ND women scene.  
&gt;  
&gt;It would be a selfish hope of mind that most men implement the MPDG trope as I already know I wont have that problem. Making me valuable.  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;I can look out for someones needs thus making me a valuable commodity.

And here, where he also says the quiet part out loud:

&gt;But I have to admit that Im relieved that all I have to do to stand out and rise above most men in the eyes of ND women is literally treat you as a person who has needs, feelings, and vulnerabilities/weaknesses to assist her in protecting herself.  
&gt;  
&gt;If thats really all it takes then my dating fate is in good hands it seems.  
&gt;  
&gt;(Im a little selfish I guess because it sounds like your problem/annoyances are my advantage over many other men. That just makes me a little too happy as I didnt think I had anything going for me.)

And finally, here, where he's instructing us on how to move in our own safe space:

&gt;Are you saying you want me too treat a woman as a MPDG if that were my authentic nature?  
&gt;  
&gt;Stop speaking madness,  
&gt;  
&gt;when a man comes over because he wants to make sure hes enforcing gender equality upon himself towards others you aught not to punish him for his pursuit.  
&gt;  
&gt;It sounds like your past traumas are triggering your brain into thinking Im just looking for a aspie girl to use and throw away  
&gt;  
&gt;Strategy is an intelligent move in dating. If I think I will find better connections with people who think like me then what is wrong with that?  
&gt;  
&gt;In the name of authenticity do I opt into stagnation? I could simply be stupid because thats exactly how Im talking your statement.

This person was agreeing with all of the comments that were either praising him for doing the barest of minimum by asking how to not be an asshole, or giving him answers that he could have googled on the internet. Even his answers were all shallow and samey, and doing the typical, ""Oh, see, I was rude because I didn't know that, and now I know, sowwy"" bullshit that some grown men on the spectrum do when they absolutely know better. A look into his comment history outside of this post tells a dark, incel-y story as well. It is abundantly clear that he came here to get his ego stroked. And that isn't our job.

I'm sick of it. Men and women on the spectrum do NOT have the same problems. Do men on the spectrum have problems? Of course they do! But they aren't the same, and the problems women face are oft overlooked... there's a reason we rarely get diagnosed prior to our 20s/30s in the first place.

There are women in the comments stating that they feel like their space was violated. And I do, too, when I go to somewhere to discuss my issues and things that are affecting my particular slice of intersectionality, and have men barge in to invalidate my experiences. Disagreeing is fine, but invalidating is something else entirely, and that's what this weird incel is doing.

So my proposal is that we perform a blanket ban on cis men here. I do not want to see pander-y posts like this on this sub. This sub exists to help women on the spectrum by either giving us a sense of solidarity or giving us actionable tips. It never has (and never should) be a place to teach men. If they really want to know about the things that affect us, they need to lurk and take notes, not come in to argue with us. If we REALLY, TRULY must allow them a space to speak (as if they don't hold space literally everywhere else), we could have a heavily moderated weekly megathread for them and their questions or something (as much as I hate it I feel like this could be a good ""pressure valve""). This is not out of hatred for men in any capacity. Couldn't date men as a cishet woman, work in a predominantly cishet male field (software engineering), or have cishet male friends if I did. This is 100% about our protection.

Who's interested in this idea? If this post gains traction, can the mods please weigh in?

**EDIT 2: Another commenter brought to my attention that there are family members and boyfriend's of autistic women that sometimes do come through and ask questions in good faith - my suggested solution was a weekly moderated thread where men and family members of people with autism could go. That way, they can get the help they need (if they legitimately want it) or drop off a polite/well-intended, ""Good job ladies!"" in a place the rest of us don't even have to see it if we don't want to. How would something like that make you all feel?**

**EDIT 3: I want to be clear that this ban does not extend to trans autistic women, nor does it with AFAB folks because of their shared experiences. This proposal includes ALL women being welcome here.**

**EDIT 4: As far as enforcing the rule, there are plenty of ways to accomplish this. Moderation bots that insta-ban anyone the moment that they post in a list of subreddits like incel subs, things like ""Country Club"" posts from black people Twitter, which is like a verification process for each individual that enters, another bot feature that doesn't allow users to post if their account wasn't made in the last month or if they don't have around at least 50 karma (therefore, a low-effort spam account), etc. There's also provisionally monitoring posters for a few weeks, and simply moderating *more*.**

**There are a few dozen subs that do this successfully. Combine this with possibly creating an r/AskWomenOnTheSpectrum or something to that affect and men really can interact with autistic women that *are* willing to answer their questions.**

**What I find hilarious is that I've seen a poster or two here say that no autistic women would go there, so that wouldn't work... how is that not telling that, if given the chance, they're saying no autistic woman on Reddit would willing partake in conversation with people potentially asking bad faith questions/men who are either not on the spectrum or men who are? Funny how they're so horrified by their treatment/feel so unsafe that they wouldn't even volunteer to do this so we should... just keep letting them involuntarily see posts from men/actors in bad faith? These comments are literally filled with men doing just that.**","AutismInWomen",559,"https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismInWomen/comments/x6lnpc/id_like_to_petition_that_we_not_allow_cis_men_to/"
