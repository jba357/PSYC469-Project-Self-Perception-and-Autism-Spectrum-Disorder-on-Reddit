"What is nonverbal and why you can't ""go nonverbal""","2023-03-28",1680019321,"What is nonverbal and why you can't ""go nonverbal""","Hi everyone, my goal on this website is to bring awareness of level 2 and 3 autism which are often left out in our community. I made a post yesterday about changing the word ""go nonverbal"" to mutism and I see that some people don't understand what is being nonverbal so I will explain.

People who are nonverbal cannot **physically** produce speech. It's either an issue on your **motor skills** that keep you from producing sounds and therefore speech or a language impairment in which your brain **doesn't understand language** overall. I have an example from when I was a kid, if you asked me what my name was, I would point (I used PECS) to my age. I would do that because I didn't understand language, my brain just didn't hear words. 

When you are **able to physically produce language with no phonological/grammar mistakes**, you can't be nonverbal. There is no discussion. What happens to most of level 1 and 2 autistics is that you can **perfectly produce speech but there are situations that affect you psychologically and you are unable to speak for a certain period of time**. This is what I like to call autistic mutism. 

My choice to name it that way is:

1. It's psychological, not physical (meaning your brain and phonological organs are perfect), so it can't be nonverbal/nonspeaking.
2. ""Autistic"" because it differs from mutism in an anxiety disorder, since when it occurs with anxiety disorder, it has a few reasons/triggers, but in autism, the triggers and the reasons are different. For example one autistic person might have difficulty speaking if they are sensorily overwhelmed. 

It's important that we use the right words to talk about our experiences because that way we can respect our nonverbal friends. Nonverbal used to be a word to describe a very unique experience of being physically unable to produce speech and we are using it to describe a completely different experiences. That causes our nonverbal friends to be even more left out than they already are, because you will see autistics who have no issues with speech claim that they understand/can speak about the experience of those who actually are nonspeaking. 

I will not elaborate on why it's wrong from us to use this word to talk about mutism. I can recommend a few nonverbal friends who have written about why tell feel offended by this use. 

""But I have **constant** issues with speech, what about me?"" That's where the ICD-11 and a speech therapist come in. The ICD-11 will classify autistics in categories: 

\- Presence or not of Intellectual Disability and is it mild, moderate or severe.

\- Presence or not of functional language impairment and is it mild, moderate or severe.

My case is classified as mild functional language impairment as I am capable of producing *most* (not all) sounds perfectly but have quite severe issues with breathing, tone, speed and some more things. Reminder that just ""speaking like a robot"" which is usually used to describe how autistic people speak is **not enough** to classify language impairment. People who are nonspeaking fit the severe category and people who are semi-speaking (which means you can produce up to 30 words, if I'm not mistaken by the number) fit the moderate and probably severe category. 

These speech issues are caught on very easily, it's very hard to go undiagnosed, even if you are not diagnosed with ASD, you might be diagnosed with global language impairment in the ICD-10 or ICD-11 (but in ICD-11 you can't be diagnosed with language impairment at the same time as ASD since the ASD category already classifies us with/without language impairment).

But, still, if you have a lot of trouble with speech, your case might be similar to mine. But **only a speech therapist** can make a full evaluation of your speech and tell you if you classify as language impairment or not. 

If that's not your case, what you experience is mutism. It's not ""going nonverbal"", it's not being ""semi-verbal"". These mean things completely different. Let's listen to our nonverbal friends, let's give them space to talk about their own experiences without having perfectly speaking autistics come and say that they ""go nonverbal too"". Let's respect the experience of those of us with higher support needs. 

We listen to you, we listen to you all the time. I learned what is masking, I learned that some people are late-diagnosed, I learned that for some people autism is an invisible disability. I had no clue these things existed. So, please, do the same to us and listen to our experiences. Listen to what we have to say, give us space and don't speak over us.

EDIT: To those of you saying that nonverbal doesnt mean what I tried to explain here in the dictionary lets imagine I am NT and I say that I mask in Social situations, wouldnt it be offensive for autistics who are burnt out from masking their whole lives to hear that from an NT? Its the same thing with nonverbal. Mask has the same meaning in the dictionary but you will agree with me that nothing compares to the experience of autistic masking.","autism",436,"https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/124tkis/what_is_nonverbal_and_why_you_cant_go_nonverbal/"

"She stood me up and said I am sorry, you are autistic, I know how that can be hard for you","2023-07-08",1688860577,"She stood me up and said I am sorry, you are autistic, I know how that can be hard for you","Thats hard for everyone! This is mostly just a rant. 

Yesterday this woman from college (23) asked me out to the movies, we know each other for about 1 year, and this was supposed to be our second real date outside of college. 

At our first date she asked me go over to her house to watch a movie, after the invite she said I am not inviting you to have sex if you dont feel like it, I replied with Ok, I dont want to have sex, the night was good we made popcorn, watched the movie, kissed a little bit, played video games and I went back home.

She usually invites me to things last minute which I dont like and end up not going so for yesterdays date she asked me with a week in advance. She asked me to go to the movies. The movie was 8pm, I had been texting her during the afternoon saying that I was studying but everything was settled, she texted me at around 4pm saying that she was already getting ready. 

At 7:30 I texted her saying that I was leaving my house. No reply. I texted again when I arrived at 7:45. She replied with I am running a little bit late, I said Ok, I am gonna buy our tickets. I waited by the door till 8:05 and no message after that, so I got in. 

At around 9:00 she messaged me Ill be leaving me house really soon, I said the movie is about to end, and her response was what do you wanna do?, I said after the movie I am going home, she said ok.

Midway through the night she texted me saying I am sorry, you are autistic, I know how that can be hard for you. I didnt reply.

I am just mad.

Edit 1 - Update: First of all, I dont condone calling her any misogynistic slur, so please dont. 

She texted me again inviting me to a party at her house last night, I am not one for parties especially with people I do not know and we have talked about this already, and of course I am still mad about the matter we havent discussed. 

The conversation went as followed: 
She said I am having a party at my house today at around 6pm If you can come
I replied with ok, I dont want to go
She said sure

I was so confused as to why she was still invinting me to things after she stood me up, I planned on not even repling, but I couldnt. 

I am thinking about sending her this message 

Hey! How are things? I dont know if you notice but I was quite upset after you stood me up on our date, its not solely because I am autistic! Everyone would be, thats unacceptable! If you had personal problems which meant that you were not going to be able to make it, only a text would solve all of this stress, you didnt have to be specific about what were those problems. Things cant go back to the way they were if there isnt a better  way to communicate. Also It seems recent but I would like to know your intent with our relationship, you can be upfront and tell me if you are looking just for sex, if so I can tell you already that we are not a match. Hopefully we can solve this peacefully and see what works for the both of us either way it goes, thanks

Edit 2 - Update: I texted that, and she replied with 

Hi! I was rlly running late that day, rlly sorry. I wanted to watch the movie with u but mostly I wanted to see you. It wasnt the plan to leave you hanging. Im interested in u but Ive never been with an autistic man before, so Idk how to work things out sometimes

I said 

What do you mean by You dont know how to work things out?. 

She said

Idk what should I do, sometimes Idk if u actually want to be with me. U never ask me out, when we were watching the movie at my house u were with your arms crossed during most of the movie. So sometimes Idk what to say when I want more

I said

I think you are overthinking it. You dont need a textbook as to how to date an autistic man, its a spectrum, the one that knows best on how to deal with me is myself, just ask.

I didnt even notice that I was with my arms crossed but I was a little bit nervous, It was our first actual date, also I am not one to like hugging all the way throughout a movie. When the movie was over we listened to songs, hugged, kissed, that was nice, that was our intimate moment, that works for me.

Also, having different expectations for our first date doesnt excuse your behavior on the second date. I am reiterating that it was very inconsiderate

The mums and dads, the carers, the older NT siblings who absolutely bummed off the puzzle piece. They love it - they had the t shirts. The water bottles, they had the car bumper stickers. 

Now the children who went to the school (absolutely wonderful school, brilliant employer, brilliant brilliant brilliant. Cant fault the school - they do wonderful work). But the children who were at the school were at a point in the ad spectrum where they werent all able to communicate verbally / they needed 1:1 care and most of their decision making was done by their adults. (With the best interested truly intended, in 90% of scenarios). But yes, they were not picking out these puzzle piece merch items themselves.

She has a mask on still in 2023 (no issue with that, it just points to immunity problems), issues communicating, social awkwardness, anxiety, strange posture, etc, just several signs of neurodivergence.

My coworker goes, I dont like her, shes weird. I ask how. She says I dont know, shes just weird. I say, No but like, how, can you give me an example? She says that shes always talking about creepy horror movies she watches and that she makes puppets.  

Socially, Im very hyperaware of myself and my behavior and how to mask, so my coworker did not pick up that weird vibe from me, but I know how it feels to be avoided and talked about and bullied in the work and school place for being different or not masking well enough. When I start working Im gonna talk to her all day about her weird puppets and horror movies.

So I had to go to the dentist today to get some fillings. I go to check in at the front desk and I did not recognize anyone behind the desk when I was just there a month ago. She told me to sign something electronically which I had never done before at that office and felt sus bc I had no idea what I was signing. Then she hands me a clipboard and has me initial and then sign by hand so I was confused as to why I just e-signed at all. Then she tells me they changed systems within the last month and that Id have to refill out all my history paperwork after they send me a link to my cell phone. 

At that moment, a fuse must have just burst in my mind because all of my senses turned up by 100. All the sudden I noticed that things were very loud and it seemed like all of the sounds were overlapping instead of integratinglaying on top of each other and echoing inside my head. The lights were hitting the tops of my eyes and causing physical pain. I was hot, hungry, tired and now nauseous from the intense barrage of senses.

Yet, the front desk person was still there, holding the clipboard and starting to stare. The rest of the dental office seemed to be staring, too. 

I took the clipboard eventually. I tried to go sit in one of the waiting room chairs, but the speakers for the waiting room music were directly over the only available chair and the closer I got, the more intense the pain became. I couldnt take another step, but I was worried about the social implications involved if I did or did not. 
Instead I planted my feet and shouted, 
ITS TOO LOUD. ITS TOO LOUD IN HERE. THE MUSIC IS TOO LOUD. I HAVE AUTISM!! 

Well, on accident anyway. I didnt mean to yell, and I wasnt screaming or anything. It was more out of panic. 

But-I remember my eyes being closed when I said it all and I was kind of scared to open my eyes. I was expecting them to be terrified or angry or actively escorting me out, maybe? Idk. They werent. The front desk person turned down the music really quickly, apologized to me and then&things just went on. 

Anyway. I put in my earplugs and put my hood up and started to feel better. Im eating my favorite dinner and my teeth look great.","autism",101,"https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/16u3bzs/ended_up_yelling_i_have_autism_in_my_dentists/"

&amp;#x200B;

I have a daughter, she's 9 years old. Was diagnosed with ADHD when the was 5. Then diagnosed with Autism at 6. 

&amp;#x200B;

She is in a school that specializes in children with learning disabilities. She has an IEP. And she takes the prescribed medication. - But I haven't actually given her the word ""Autism"" yet. I don't feel like I'm hiding it. I have mentioned it a couple of times, but she hasn't really wrapped her head around it. - So I guess I have given her the word, but I haven't sat down and had a serious conversation where I made her understand that she has Autism. 

&amp;#x200B;

I should mention that she is high functioning. She's great at math. Very social. Loves talking to people. She's very kind and empathetic. - She knows that she's different than other kids. But she also knows that everyone is unique in their own way. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any thoughts are appreciated.

Edit: First I want to say how much I appreciate all of your thoughtful comments. And I'm so sorry for the negative experiences some of you have had - I do want to clarify that I have no intention of NOT telling her, I just wasn't sure if I should tell her yet. - Based on all your comments, the resounding response is that I need to tell her right away. Thanks so much for your insight. I failed to see things from her perspective, and the fact that so many of you have gone through the same thing and are willing to share your stories is just amazing. 

20 years ago, if a parent was questioning the best way to educate their autistic child, they would never have a resource like this. There might be a few books in the library and maybe the advice of a friend who had a friend that knew someone that had a weird kid. - But this many first hand experiences? Who are willing to share and help a perfect stranger on the internet? What a time to be alive, folks. 

I will be sitting down with her this week and will explain everything. And in a few years, I'll let her know about this awesome community.

Edit 2: This has really blown up. I just want you to know that I am making sure to read every single comment and that I appreciate all of you.

Edit 3: Your comments are still coming in, Im still reading every one. I can see this topic resonates with so many of you. I really appreciate all the different perspectives. Most of you have been so kind, and I really appreciate that. - I think that deep down, I didnt want my daughter to feel like she has a disability. That shes an outcast. I didnt want her to approach the world using Autism as a crutch every time things dont go her way. But I see now its just the opposite. Knowledge is power. 

Its heartbreaking to read that so many of you have been hurt by the decisions of your parents. I wish you the very best in your lifelong journey of self exploration.","autism",541,"https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/164ggvt/i_havent_told_my_daughter_that_she_has_autism/"

"Doomed to starve in my room due to people being in the kitchen","2024-01-03",1704311873,"Doomed to starve in my room due to people being in the kitchen","This is a humorous post that I'm making out of hunger and boredom. I normally live alone, but I am spending a couple months renting a room in a shared house with my friends. It's been lovely, but yesterday we were at the cinema with a group of people and I very suddenly and completely ran out of social battery. My autistic friend noticed and I let my housemates know that I have reached my limit on consecutive days of human contact, and I would be going into gremlin mode so not to worry or try to get me to come out of my room. Today I slept until 4 pm, mildly worried about burnout, went out with my dog and then had a cup of tea in the kitchen while my autistic friend/housemate was making herself food, wearing headphones so at no risk of conversation. 

I haven't had any food yet today at all, I just got up and took my dog out to run then had a shower. I started to get really hungry and was making myself a soup&amp;sandwich. My other housemate came in, turned on all the big ceiling lights and started to sweep the kitchen while two of us were cooking, and also changing all the  bin bags and stuff. I became extremely overwhelmed and left all my cooking as it was and quickly went into my room to put on my headphones. I checked a couple times to see when they'd leave the kitchen so I could keep cooking. It has been a while, they were still there talking and doing stuff. Now I checked again and there is more people in the house?? And they're all in the kitchen talking and laughing. I have accepted my fate of dying a slow but cozy hunger death in my bed.

"Please, listen to level 2 and 3 autistics.","2022-09-07",1662591869,"Please, listen to level 2 and 3 autistics.","Hi guys, this is not an attack to the community, I just want to bring some attention to this matter. I was diagnosed with moderate autism at the age of 6. Currently my diagnosis is based on the ICD-11, ASD with mild-moderate speech impairment and no intellectual disability. Recently on this sub, there was a controversial post about taking back the puzzle piece symbol from autism moms/ASpeaks etc. I personally believe this can't be discussed easily. But, I really wish that some of you understood I can't leave my house without wearing my puzzle piece lanyard. No, the infinity symbol or the sunflower aren't well-known in my non-European/North American country. I have a very hard time speaking, I get overwhelmed very easily and the puzzle piece helps me navigate daily quite independently. It allows me to get special attendance on the subway, stores and basically anywhere with lines. My autism lanyard helps people be more patient with me when I have a hard time speaking. Taking that symbol back would be so helpful to me because sometimes I get left out in autism groups by saying I use it daily and people get angry saying I support AS etc which is definitely not the case.

This is just an example of things that usually level 1 autistics don't think about. Level 2 and 3 autistics are most of the time either infantilized by our families or left out in autism groups and discussions about neurodiversity. You all might have noticed that most autistic popular creators inside and outside our community are level 1 and yeah, I get it, NTs prefer listening to autistics who speak well etc, but I really wish our community made an effort to listen to us. 

Also when recently talking about levels/support needs/whatever other classification of autism and I hear a lot of people saying it doesn't make sense to classify us. I do agree that this isn't perfect but it is important to have it. When I email a teacher of mine saying I am autistic it is important they know I cannot control my stimming, I cannot 'properly' speak and sometimes I won't answer when they talk to me. That is why I like labels. Also, I know it's all about inclusivity but I have been told to be ""moderate autistic"" since I was 6 years old, I can't even change my seat in class without having a meltdown, can you imagine how hard it is to change the way I have been called my whole life? I am working on it but you all know autistics have a hard time with change. 

This isn't an attack as I said. I just get sad sometimes and really wish other autistics thought about us too and didn't get angry when I say I wear the puzzle piece or stuff like this. I know it's also something that there are more level 1 autistics than level 2 and 3 so that might also be the reason why we don't get much attention but yeah that is it guys... thanks for reading.","autism",336,"https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/x8jfhl/please_listen_to_level_2_and_3_autistics/"

I found out my lovely, charming, beautiful guy has been swiping on Tinder since December. :(



I started dating an autistic man, 30, straight. I don't mean to sound dumb but he fascinates me. I've never met anyone like this before, but I would like some insight as I have no autistic friends, colleagues or know much about these great people's personalities and traits.
So I'll just say it - the sex is mind blowing, I've never experienced anything like it before, he constantly checks in and asks if I'm satisfied, have I ""done what I need to do"", what can he change if I'm not there yet, and doesn't stop until I'm satisfied. He gives very little compliments or signs of affection outside the bedroom but I can see how he makes up for it. As in if he wasn't so caring while having sex, I would think he's not romantically interested in me. I've told him verbally how much I like him but he hasn't reciprocated. What's a good way to keep this going or make sure I know he's really comfortable around me?","autism",175,"https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/18f6wob/nsfw_autistic_man_in_bed/"

i only have one possible explanation as to why

TW //// Traumatic Event 

One time,my family packed up and left home to travel around the whole country (Australia)
but because of something my teen self decided i had enough of it i ended up getting some americans we met to call Centrelink to get her carers pay cutoff because apparently doing something like that i didnt want to is abuse (its not,and even if it was,i didnt protest til i realised i couldnt have my devices charged up without using the generator)

Because of that,she didnt find out til we broke down in the middle of Nothern Territories (hottest state on record) and mum let us have the drinks she had lefr while she lived off bore water 

we eventually got rescued when a family friend loaned us money to the nearest town,which just happened to suddenly have heavy rain going on

i still blame myself for it all

**What is ABA?** From [Medical News Today](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/aba-therapy):

&gt;ABA therapy attempts to modify and encourage certain behaviors, particularly in autistic children. It is not a cure for ASD, but it can help individuals improve and develop an array of skills.

&gt;This form of therapy is rooted in behaviorist theories. This assumes that reinforcement can increase or decrease the chance of a behavior happening when a similar set of circumstances occurs again in the future.

"I am a server. I waited on someone with autism and cant stop thinking about it.","2023-05-14",1684053390,"I am a server. I waited on someone with autism and cant stop thinking about it.","I (20M) work at a popular soul food chain in the southeast part of the United States. For starters, I have autism and am high functioning. I have been working as a waiter for 3 years to help myself with social interactions and overstimulating environments. 

Tonight, I was nearing the end of my shift. I had about three tables eating and didnt need anything from me. A man, about mid thirties, is seated in my section and I go up to greet him. I introduce myself and the first thing he does is ramble to me about sirloin steaks and the proper way to cook them and so on. This goes on for several minutes. I patiently listened as my other tables were happy. He goes on to explain that every time he comes in to the restaurant I work at, they always seem to mess up his steak. Usually when someone says this to me, it comes off as malicious towards me and the other staff. That was not the case for this guy. He just explained how he wanted the steak and even showed me pictures. I went to the back and placed his order and went about my shift.

Approximately ten minutes later his plate is ready. I take one look at the steak and I see that its over done. I cringe because this guy was very adamant about his steak. I decided to bring it out anyway and let his see. 

I put it down in front of him and ask if its still acceptable or if he would like it remade, calmly.  He looked at it and I watched him start to panic. He wasnt angry. Definitely flustered, but not angry. I told him that I was sorry about the steak and I could get it remade if he wanted. He looked up at me on the verge of tears and said he didnt want to waste the steak or upset anyone and he wished that the kitchen had just made the steak properly.

Im used to the angry guests that regularly come in. But this was different. I knew this wasnt just about steak. I reassured him that no one was angry with him and that it was no problem to get him a replacement. Throughout my efforts to calm him down I noticed a man from one of my other tables really getting a kick out of this guy. Laughing and loudly talking about him and such. This didnt help the situation at all. 

I managed to calm him down enough to leave and get the new steak. When I brought it back, he was happy with it. I debated on doing this, but I decided to ask him if he was doing ok. He got quiet and kind of mumbled Im autistic. Im sorry. I always do this.

Thats when it all clicked for me. After that, him and I discussed life with autism together and his demeanor completely changed. He happily told me all that he could about steaks and his other special interests. I was happy to listen as I could tell this guy didnt get to talk about this to many people. All the while, the guy at my other table was still talking loudly about him. Even though I was trying my best to keep my attention to this guy, my blood was starting to boil.

Eventually, the man being disrespectful got up to leave and hollered at me Good luck! And then walked away laughing. 

I dont really know what Im looking for by posting this. Did I handle this properly? Should I have said something to the ignorant asshole? Im not sure. I will say that is currently 3 AM where I am and cant sleep because I cant stop thinking about it.","autism",144,"https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/13h6s7n/i_am_a_server_i_waited_on_someone_with_autism_and/"

"Why dont people believe me when I say I prefer to walk?","2023-08-04",1691157947,"Why dont people believe me when I say I prefer to walk?","I bought a house that was within an hour walk of everything i could possibly need. I do not have a car, but my roommate does. He totally gets me preferring to walk and even walks with me sometimes. 

Other than that, friends, family, and coworkers are BAFFLED by my choice to walk places. 

If someone I know sees me walking somewhere, they pull over and offer me a ride. They insist they dont mind, as if i am lying when I tell them I prefer to walk. 

I love walking, i can listen to music while looking at the sky, I can almost completely zone out as well without almost killing anyone. It also keeps me from overspending since I can only carry so much home. 

Getting home after walking, i feel SO good. Like, my legs are tired but in a good way. 

I used to work right near my house- about a 45 minute walk away. I would try to walk to and from work and my coworkers would ARGUE with me to try to get me to get a ride home. Because a 45 minute walk is ""terrible."" I used to have an hour and a half walk to and from work, I GENUINELY do not mind walking. Even after a long day of work, it's a good cool-down.

Is there some sort of social rule I am breaking? I am genuinely confused, i find it wasteful to drive places when i PREFER to walk, just to appease others. 

The ONLY thing i get is potentially being concerned for my safety, but during daytime it is not any more unsafe than any other mode of transportation.","autism",327,"https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/15i10w3/why_dont_people_believe_me_when_i_say_i_prefer_to/"

I present as very neurotypical because I have great hygiene, wear makeup, like fashion and am of average attractiveness. Theres this perception from family, friends, coworkers, and my partner that it doesnt affect me much. Well it has to be very mild, was was my mother said when I told her about my diagnosis. 

But it affects me greatly and it hurts. It took me 7 years to get my bachelors degree, and I always struggled with school. I had meltdowns nearly every day in college. I had screaming, physical meltdowns as a kid, up until my teen years. This weekend I was in a rage all day because I had to go to a party that I didnt want to. I have meltdowns due to overstimulation, I cant handle not wearing noise cancelling headphones constantly, I struggle maintaining my current friendships, I have to have alarms just to remind myself to text people back daily. I have very little interests in maintaining friendships, but I do love my friends. It bothers me that a simple packaging change on my favorite drinks or a change in plans ruins my day.  I have scripts for every conversation and act out conversations in my car. My ASD/ADHD affects me greatly. Ive been in therapy nearly my entire life to perfect my alien assigned to the human world act. I want to scream when people tell me it comes off as mild, because I dont know how to make them understand how devastating it can feel to put in 100x the effort to get 50% of the result that I want.

As above, a lot of posts and comments in support of things like: autism shouldnt be a diagnosis, its just a way of being. Autism isnt a disorder, the world and society is just made for NT. We should get rid of levels because if you are autistic you are autistic and levels create a divide etc&.

In a perfect world, all of the above could be true. In the real world, I have level 2 autism with many level 3 symptoms and traits, I can not live without support. I can not drive, work or live independently. I am very much impaired by this disorder. It is a disorder. I dont participate in my community or the society very often because my home is my safe place. I need support and accommodations to get through every day. My executive functioning is impaired as well as my fine  motor skills. Even if I am supervised and trying to be independent by say, cooking, I am often injured. I need reminders and a lot of effort to do basic things like shower or make my bed. I sound weird, though I am starting speech therapy soon. I cant talk more than a few sentences at a time and often cant find words or speak at all. I have involuntary stims that are pretty prevalent in my day. If Im too overwhelmed I get awful vocal stims I cant stop which can last 24 hours. It makes me more anxious which causes a terrible stim loop which I cant get out of. My sensory issues are extreme. I cant touch carpet with my skin. I cant cope with other people doing the same. (Just one example).  I have no social life at all, I have all the usual autistic social difficulties but at a level 2 and 3. Seriously I have 0 friends. It doesnt bother me because I dont understand friendships and feel like they are difficult for both sides but I think in theory it would be nice to have a friend. 

There is no amount of acceptance for autistic people, accommodations, exceptions or empathy that can change my life significantly where I can be independent or completely fulfilled. When Aspergers was a diagnosis, which now mostly transfers to be a level 1 or below, that group was very vocal about inclusiveness in society and at times even a superiority than NT. 

Please dont forget us higher support needs, those of us who will likely never function like a NT or even level 1, those of us who are just trying to make it through a day safely. Autism is a disorder, it causes clinically significant impairment. Those of us who have more severe symptoms and traits are often forgotten or overlooked. I have seen some comments and posts trying to recognise us and include us but the content and their theories are not realistic. 

We have been fortunate that someone created a sub group for higher level autistic people. This has been increasingly visited and commented in by lower support need autistics. That is absolutely fine, but I did see recently a self dx person arguing and talking over a level 2 in the spicy sub. I dont want to cause any hurt or discontent but I felt compelled as I feel like I dont have a space that understands or even properly considers people like me. I dont think it is purposeful, perhaps more education is needed but we are all autistic and should be mindful of each other and support each other.","autism",412,"https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1008zfz/just_a_reminder_that_level_2_and_3_autistic/"

Why do people want to claim a develeopmental disorder that impacts every day life a ""Different ability""

The primary symptoms are just impairments

Issues forming/Holding relationships/friendships, Issues with socialisation and understanding it, Issues with non verbal communication etc

Theres nothing about the main symptoms which is ""good""

And even at the most basic level, it has to be impairing to be considered Autism. So why are people trying to claim we aren't disabled?

Sure i have some interesting aspects as part of being autistic, but how does that make it not a disability? I still have all my impairments

"my biggest childhood bully died.","2023-04-11",1681240119,"my biggest childhood bully died.","a couple days ago, i found out that my biggest middle school &amp; high school bully died tragically, in a car accident. this particular person tormented me all throughout middle school and high school and contributed greatly to the reason i was hospitalized for the first time at 12 for wanting to die. the things she said and did to me were horrible and have stuck with me to this day, as an adult (22). she made fun of my autistic traits, embarrassed me, harassed me, and made me hate myself. it wasnt just minor bullying. she was even suspended at one point for what she did to me.

when i was outed as gay, her and her friends spread rumors that i liked all the girls in the grade and they would hide away from me in locker rooms or just act generally uncomfortable around me, even though i didnt have a crush on any of them. she and her friends also bullied other autistic and neurodivergent kids.

my emotions are so complex right now. i am not happy that she died and if i could bring her back, i would. i dont think she deserved to die. however, i am feeling very triggered about everyone commemorating her and talking about how much of an amazing person and sweet soul she was. she was extremely popular, and a lot of the people who are posting are her friends who also severely bullied me. its just triggering. i didnt say anything publicly because i know i wouldnt have anything productive to say. but i needed a space to get my feelings out.

everyone is devastated over her death but nobody gave a fuck when she made me WANT to die at such a young age. its just not fair.","autism",380,"https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/12iu2sk/my_biggest_childhood_bully_died/"

He has started to give me the creeps lately. He found a picture of me on social media from when I used to be goth and has been pressuring me CONSTANTLY to dye my hair blue again like in the picture. He screenshot all my pictures and showed me he did that, yet wont follow me on any social media yet stalks/keeps tabs on me. He also wants me to get tattoos and dress like that again. He got me to bring all my old goth clothes to his apartment and theyre in different places every time I come over, which tells me hes obviously doing something with them. (He snoops through my stuff in general) He shows me offensive over-sexualized pictures of tattooed/alternative women e-girls and OnlyFans creators with tattoos IN PUBLIC asking me what I think of their look and if Id change myself to look like them. 

He has some kinks and religious trauma which I am non judgemental towards but he is always trying to do BDSM and butt stuff with me, and thinks Id be into that because I used to be goth. 

He gets me to show him my old goth pictures and has tried to trick me into syncing my google photos onto his computer so he can access my pictures. I would never give him any pictures because I already caught him taking picture of me without my consent and sending them to multiple people, his family and friends. He also tries to track my location and internet usage and get money from me, but never directly talks to me about anything yet he is always trying to trick me.

He used to love bomb me but now treats me like garbage. Hes narcissistic, entitled and overall disrespectful, Ive told him that I dont want tattoos and wont dye my hair and that goth is a music subculture not a kink and he never listens. He shames my body, my finances, my clothes, where I live, the list goes on. (He doesnt listen to me in general and I feel like an object.) He never wants to do any fun activities with me and Im always compromising for him. He is very straight laced and wants to go to places like goth clubs and nude beaches just to stare at women. 

Lately he has been trying to control and shame me for what I eat and also body shamed me for being fat and hairy (I am 58 120lbs, I am on the skinny side.) he wants me to body build but also not eat anything?? It doesnt make sense. He points out other women exercising and takes a little dig at me. He wants me to spend thousands of dollars on my appearance yet he has terrible hygiene and wont even comb his hair and brush his teeth for me. He likes parading me around like a show pony while he looks practically homeless. Its humiliating.

He is classist and calls me poor for being upper middle class and inflates how wealthy he and his family are, yet never pays. His brother shamed me when I met him. Made me feel awful.

We have problems in our sex life as well, he has a hard time ejaculating and checks out other women all the time. He acts 12. He is 27. I feel controlled, devalued, criticized, unheard, and taken for granted. He is full of shame and I cant get him to have an adult conversation about any of these issues. I tried to end it twice and he starts sobbing and telling me how much he needs me, loves me, cares about me, thinks Im brilliant, etc. practically begging me to stay. I feel used and manipulated; hes an awful, reprehensible person.","autism",878,"https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/14vbcdq/my_autistic_boyfriend_is_creeping_me_out/"

It's okay to not be autistic. If you went in for an assessment thinking you're autistic and didn't receive the diagnosis or received a different one, that's okay. 

It's not always the system being wrong. It's not always because you're a woman, an adult or a specific race. It's possible that you truly do not have autism. There are other things that can ""mimic"" autism or you just don't have ""enough"" symptoms to be considered autistic (referencing the idea that everyone is a little autistic which is stupid). 

Of course, some people truly get misdiagnosed or don't receive a diagnosis because of the system, but it's not always. If the person diagnosing you has valid reasons, listen to them.

After learning from some informative people in this thread, I think the correct and necessary thing for people to do is completely cease to argue whether suspected/self diagnosis is valid and instead say please say suspected instead of self diagnosed without further judgment or evaluation to avoid shaming suspected autistics.

The debate is self diagnosis valid is needlessly demeaning and perpetuates stigma and exclusion against actually autistic undiagnosed people who need love, help, and support. 

Either way shaming and excluding undiagnosed suspected autistic people as a group for any reason especially a few bad actors is foul, shaming them for having it too easy and not going through what I went through or doing it for clout and attention is DUSTY and foul and I stand by my original point, but blaming them for causing neurotypical stigma is foulest of all, breaking solidarity with undiagnosed actually autistic suspecting people is obscene - and if you think it protects our best interests as a group, divide and conquer is exactly what bigots want, so choose love and solidarity instead.

Original Post

Self-diagnosis is valid.

Be happy for other autistic people who dont have to struggle as much as you did.

Stop being a Karen and taking your trauma out on other people. Fix your own sh*t. 

Be happy the world is becoming a better place for us, even at a snails pace.

Stop giving neurotypical bigots fodder to use against us.

A handful of people self-diagnosing for the wrong cringy reasons do not invalidate all self-diagnosed people.

Deal with your internalized ableism and choose solidarity instead.

If you want to be negative or abusive in your comments or posts because someone can't get a diagnosis, you will be asked to go elsewhere.    

There are many many reasons why someone may not be able to get a legitimate diagnosis. Children of parents who don't agree with the child about getting tested. Not having services in your area or country. Not having insurance that accepts it. Not having a supportive government entity while paying taxes. Not having enough to pay out of pocket... I could go on and on.     

This sub is for news, information AND SUPPORT. If you want to gatekeep something, go somewhere else. The comments and reports I've gone through this morning are **disgusting** to see this early.

Lack of contact with other neurodivergent individuals is equivalent to living life on an alien planet for a young undiagnosed child.

Ive been diagnosed for over half a year and I havent even peeled back the first layer of the onion yet. I keep having eureka moments where the dots starting connecting a bit more and more.

All those thoughts, feelings, and actions I suppressed to fit in. I always tried but was just the smart, weird kid. I was constantly analyzing behavior and wondering what I did wrong. I got used to saying sorry even if something wasnt my fault.

I ignored my sensory issues so much I disassociated. Imagine how that affects any autistic child without neurodivergent peers to talk to. Thoughts of Am I normal? Whats happening to me? I must be crazy! are the reality for us.

Its no wonder so many autistic adults grow up with constant anxiety and depression. But that is all the more reason we need to be kind to ourselves. I hope everyone reading this has a wonderful day.

I said that what he said wasn't nice and for her to laugh along with him just proves her character as well. She seemed annoyed and told me kids will be kids.

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to thank everyone who read my story and commented. Thank you all of your kind and supportive words. **I went ahead and left him**. So I went to his apartment yesterday and told him in the most adult, respectful way I could possibly manage that I cannot be in a relationship with him. I told him I wasn't being respected and that he was crossing my boundaries, that he was trying to change me, pick on me, and was generally cruel to me. I pretty much told him everything he was doing wrong except for the control/tracking/exploitation stuff because I didn't want to get into that for the sake of my safety, and by the end of our two and a half hour conversation I was heading into shutdown territory so I had to leave.

I'm pretty sure he filmed the interaction, he has a camera in his room and I thought I saw it turn on. Really nothing to see other than me gently informing him I will not tolerate such disrespect, and that I thought he was trying to change me and didn't desire me, etc. He denied all negative allegations and cried the entire time and was trying to guilt me into staying (as expected.) Of course he still thought I was useful to him. To his credit he didn't get angry. I am still concerned for my safety and privacy, I am worried he will doxx me or commit some kind of cyber crime. Highly unlikely as he works for the government and his father (whom he is afraid of) controls him/pays his rent. Additionally worth noting his family name is already stained with sociopathy and there are mainstream news articles covering the crime, so it is highly unlikely he will do anything to me if he wants to get anywhere in life. Especially because he wants to seek further education and advance his career.

When I broke up with him, I could see clearly that he has severe communication deficits. I believe this is caused by a combination of the double empathy problem, distractibility and focus issues from ADHD, as well as strong narcissistic traits. I don't think he understood half of what I was saying and the impact of his actions. He apologized profusely and told me he wanted to work on our issues together and that he doesn't want to break up. He then performed a bunch of future faking and false promises to sell me on staying. I refused. I told him I crossed a line and that there is no going back, especially after body shaming. I explained to him that by body shaming someone, it will make them self conscious and uncomfortable and therefore not want to have sex with someone. That got his attention, lol.

I suspect he had a porn addiction, that he consumed at a lot of goth porn/alternative girl porn and got the wrong idea about me because I fall into some porn stereotypes targeting nerdy men; think Belle Delphine type stuff (I like Japanese culture and used to be very goth, maybe he thought I was one of those a porn content creators who had a target audience of lonely nerdy men? He was also obsessed with the idea of me playing video games and was always trying to get me to start playing them.) I know some people confuse fantasy with reality and was suspicious of that happening within our relationship. Towards the end of our time together he was focusing solely on my image as well as his and we no longer discussed anything intellectual as we did when we first began seeing each other. Our relationship had dissipated into something vapid and meaningless. This was not what I had signed up for. 

Upon further reflection, I think he really did confuse fantasy for reality and got the wrong idea about me completely, because he never listened to me when I tried to tell him what goth is about and that people have gotten the wrong in the past by assuming I was a nympho into kink due to my external appearance. Absolutely no shame in being into kink, it just is not for me right now. We were both virgins and I was not ready to go there yet. 

He always blocked out things he didn't want to hear or didn't align with the fantasy, it was startling how very little he knew about me. He told me ""that doesn't sound like you"" when I stood up for myself. He asked me ""did you hear that somewhere?"" when I told him we were having too many issues very early in the relationship and it just wasn't going to work. It's as if he didn't think I was capable of THINKING FOR MYSELF and had actual THOUGHTS. Or I wasn't going to ""script"", which is a narcissist tendency. Yet sometimes, he respected by opinion, especially regarding topics of psychology and sociology. TBH, I thought he was some fantasy person wanted me to solve all of his problems and fix his life became disenchanted when I was unable to instantly do that. He didn't know really anything about me and didn't take the time to learn about me and had some kind of fantasy version of me that existed in his head. He was more in love with the idea of having a girlfriend than me as a person.   


He thought the person in his head was THE REAL ME and that he was trying to HELP me. I do hope he seeks therapy. I wonder if he had a delusional disorder.

He also had this idea that because we were both autistic, that we must think EXACTLY the same. It doesn't work that way... we all are different colours of the spectrum and my experience differs vastly from his due to subjective experience of life, factors like gender and upbringing, etc. etc. 

I feel so stupid for allowing this to go on for as long as it did. I am proud of myself for resisting the pressure he put on me to move in with him, give him money, and change my appearance, do uncomfortable sex acts, etc. it was a fairly easy exit and civil but I still feel depressed. Mourning what could of been, perhaps. 

This is my first breakup (and his) so I am feeling all kinds of new and uncomfortable emotions and bodily sensations (I have alexithymia) so this is all very depressing and strange. I am happy with my decision and will not be looking back. I am fairly comfortable with being alone and will not be seeking a new relationship any time soon, and will perhaps enter therapy to build my self esteem. 

Writing out my situation and receiving feedback has allowed me to better understand a very complicated situation and I thank all the lovely supportive people who commented on my post.

i feel like a lot of people allude to things too much, and those same people think i sound too ""severe"" and i have been accused of exaggerating.

the thing is: i'm quite literally not exaggerating. 

in high school i was accused of lying about being raped. what else do you call it when you don't want to have sex with someone, you say no, and they keep going until they feel satisfied? that's rape, my guy. it's not ""not being ready"" or ""not knowing what i want"". it's rape.

people keep telling me i wasn't homeless. what else do you call it when you have nowhere else to go but a shelter for 2 weeks? that's called being homeless! it's not ""being in the shelter system"" or ""dropping out"" or ""having a hard time"". i was homeless.

my mom got surprised when i called myself an incest survivor. what else do you call it when your family member molests you as a child? it's called incest. it's not ""they were inappropriate with me"" or ""a bad thing that happened when i was a kid"". it's incest.

am i crazy or do people try to downplay severe shit like this?
